In adapting agile methods, the User Story is a key element. David Laribee suggested taking a look at Dan North's post on [What's In a Story](http://dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story). 

An excerpt from the introduction:



Behaviour-driven development is an “outside-in” methodology. It starts at the outside by identifying business outcomes, and then drills down into the feature set that will achieve those outcomes. Each feature is captured as a “story”, which defines the scope of the feature along with its acceptance criteria. This article introduces the BDD approach to defining and identifying stories and their acceptance criteria.


Great stuff!

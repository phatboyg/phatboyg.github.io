As I've started to use MassTransit with SignalR, one of the things that annoyed me was the hoops I had to jump through to get a nice asynchronous request from SignalR into MassTransit. There was a lot of plumbing since the MT did not support the TPL.




Well, I've changed that. With version 2.5.3 (a prerelease version on NuGet), you can now get a really nice clean syntax to return tasks from server-side SignalR hubs (and other calls that expect a Task return value.




{% gist 3061985 First.cs %}




Shown above is a SignalR hub that sends a request message off to some service. The LocationResult handler that is added within the closure returns a Task<LocationResult>, which can be returned to SignalR allowing the server-side code to remain asynchronous. If additional work needed to be done to transform the message to another type or do perform some type of validation, a .ContinueWith() could be added to the task to return the proper result type.




{% gist 3061985 Second.cs %}




If the request times out, the task for the handler will be cancelled, so be sure to take that into account.




Pretty power stuff eh?




Oh, here's a demo of how to use it with SignalR:Â [SignalRMassTransitTPLDemo.zip](/images/uploads/2012/07/SignalRMassTransitTPLDemo.zip)

It seems we aren't going to know what to expect on Tuesday, but Sony is going to launch the new expansion for EQ2. I'm not nervous, but I think it's going to be a rough week if the combat changes go live. In fact, I would be shocked if there wasn't absolute mayhem the first few days as people complain and get frustrated about spell line changes, lost master spells, gimped items, etc.

I'll be at the PDC this week, so I'll likely review the forums and talk with guild members before actually logging in to prevent any serious problems. Anyone want to bet on a rollback within 3-4 days if things hit the fan? :)

If I do play DoF this week, I'll be doing so on the lesser 9200 Inspiron instead of the XPS2 since I'll be in LA and battery life rules at a conference. Kind of a bummer that I'll miss the initial glory of DoF in full detail, but at least I'll be able to get some game time in while on the trip.

Have fun!

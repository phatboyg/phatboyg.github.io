While America was waiting to see the results of their votes, Ryan Seacrest jumped the shark and announced the contestant that was being voted off the show before a commercial break.

At approximately 40 minutes into the show after the first two home town visits, Ryan announced that after the break "and Melinda goes home tonight." After that statement, the show cut to commercial (as happens often in the results show). Both my wife and I looked at each other and said, "Did he just let slip that Melinda was going home tonight?"

At the end of the show we realized his mistake. And when the show returned from break, you could see it on her face and even Simon had that disapproving look for the rest of the night. They knew that he screwed up and said she was going home instead of mentioning that her home town visit was coming up after the break. He blew it (and what else we can only wonder) on live TV.

I'm curious to see if there will be any mention of it in the coming days and if any sort of fallout will happen.

Word on the forums ([http://atlas.asp.net](http://atlas.asp.net)) is we can expect a major CTP refresh by the end of the month. This is good news, considering the current version is from July and there is still a lot of functionality that would be nice to have in the toolkit.

I sure hope we see support for server-side asynchronous web methods in this release, we certainly need it!

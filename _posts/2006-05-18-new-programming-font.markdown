Okay, after months (perhaps years) of using Vera Sans Mono, I've moved on to a new font.

[Dina](http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Jibz/Dina/)

Check it out, a finer stroke for greater readability and the same clean separation between i, I, and l.

_**EDIT: Scratch that, back to Vera Sans Mono, Dina is just too thin to be useful after a long day. **_

My new flash drive showed up today, it's so much faster than the old one. This one averages around 24 MB/second compared to the old one that was well under 10 MB/second. This one averages under 1ms for access time as well, compared to the very fluctuating values on the old one. I'm pretty happy with it.

PowerToGo sucks though. Not only does it crash under DEP (Data Execution Prevention), it seems to not play as nicely with Vista as it should. It worked fine on the AMD system, but crashed on both Core Duo, Pentium-M systems. So I removed it and replaced it with the open source PortableApps.com launcher and we're 100% back in business. I just copied the install from my old drive and everything works great (and runs fast as hell too).

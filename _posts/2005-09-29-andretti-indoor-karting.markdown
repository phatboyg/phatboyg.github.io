While in Atlanta for work, we had a fun event last night. A bunch of us went to the [Andretti Indoor Karting](http://andrettikarting.com/) facility. They have a road course that is tight and fast with high power karts. These things haul ass and it was an awesome time!

Of course, I had to pull from my extensive track experience (yes, I called Grubb) to get the fast line and managed to whoop all my coworkers for fastest lap time. It was seriously some good fun for a group of folks wants to measure performance. :)

For those of you who have been there before, my best time was 31.258.

I finished this quest last night, what a riot. The XP was off the hook and risk was minimal. The 10,000 HP buff sure makes you feel like you're playing GOD mode in Doom. I can see myself doing this run at least one more time for the pure fun value of it. In fact, I think I'll even move the planks back over to the entrance and drop down and kill the entire zone before reclaiming the throne!

I still haven't gotten my gate shard yet, hopefully they'll fix the issue with it in the patch today. It seems that many others are having similar problems.

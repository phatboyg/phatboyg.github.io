Cruising through the Motorola site to find out the latest on their new RAZR/DVR setup, I ran across this little tidbit. I was looking at this stereo headset a few weeks ago, but bailed on it due to concerns about sound quality. Well, the concerns are still there, but it looks like it might be a pretty sweet combo package.

I'd for sure like to use my built-in Bluetooth instead, but I don't think my stack supports A2DP and the required control protocol. But if it works with iTunes and Skype at the same time, this could be a pretty sweet hook-up.

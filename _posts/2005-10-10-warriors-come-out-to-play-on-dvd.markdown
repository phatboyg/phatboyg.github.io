I picked up the new "Ultimate Director's Cut" release of "The Warriors" on DVD this past week. I watched it Friday night and it is impressive. The format is very slick and the video is extremely crisp, particularly compared to the blurry versions that have been on cable. I was surprised how clear and sharp the colors were and the detail is amazing (some might say too detailed, but face, film in that time period wasn't the sharpest so I'm sure it's been seriously processed).

I haven't taken a look at the extras yet, but the movie itself has all the impact of the first time I saw it. In fact, it was more fun based on the backstory of all the "gangs" and such. Packaging is nice with a textured slip-cover over the DVD case. This one is definitely a keeper!

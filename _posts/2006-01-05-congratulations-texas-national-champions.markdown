Tonight was an awesome game between Texas and USC in the Rose Bowl. I was so glad to see Texas win!

I'm a Big 12 guy (Nebraska by birth, OU/OSU by geography) so having a win like that in the conference is a big boost to every school. Plus with the OU win over Oregon, the Big 12 combination of offense and defense was truly superior to the PAC-10. Mind you, USC played a strong offensive game. But the hurry-up offense of the Texas Longhorns overcame the ability of USC to adjust their defense. In the end, it was the ability of Texas to put up yards fast and score quickly that won the game.

And the results are undisputed for a change, no other team is undefeated!

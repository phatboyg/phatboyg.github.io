Last night, we finally cleared the Court of Al'Afaz, including Sunchild and The Black Queen. It only took a couple of tries on the queen herself and a single attempt on Sunchild. I think that we're the only guild besides Fortitude that have beaten this zone on Kithicor to date. Some nice loot items dropped, including a new 47.4 damage piercer for me with some nice strength and agility on it.

We're looking forward to Poet's Palace: The Return tonight where hopefully we'll be victorious on at least the first three floors. Some fresh ideas and a solid raid force is all we should need to take down this zone, so let's hope we get a good turnout tonight!

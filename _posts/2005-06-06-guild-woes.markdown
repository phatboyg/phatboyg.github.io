Well, it seems likely lately Servants of Evil is a zero-activity guild. I never see anyone on anymore and all my old friends seem to have left.

So I guess I'm 43 Dirge LFG -- Looking For Guild.

I'm on Kithicor, I play from 9 PM PST until 12 PM PST almost daily and enjoy regular groups for heritage items, quests or general XP.

I'm going to the Tulsa version of the Visual Studio 2008 InstallFest tonight at the OSU Tulsa campus. The first 150 people who signed up get a free version of Visual Studio 2008 Professional in the mail. I believe the sign up list was full, but you may show up and see if you can get on the list for people that don't make it at the last minute.

Starting Sunday and ending Monday night, I went from 68 to 70. I was only about 40% through 68 when I started, and the Sunday run was a heavy one. Lots of instances and plenty of killing to get the XP needed to hit 69. Once I hit 69 just inside HoF, I managed to pull out another 40% before logging. On Monday, I whopped out another few instances and helping some guildies camp some items in PoA brought the rest of the XP out. It was some hard work, but no more grinding!

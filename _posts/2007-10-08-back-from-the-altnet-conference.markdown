I've managed to get back to Tulsa on-time thanks to Southwest Airlines. They rock, seriously. 

I'm still recovering from the weekend -- it was surprising, invigorating, frustrating, annoying, amazing, enlightening, and completely overwhelming. I'm going to let my thoughts simmer for a day or two before I share my views on the experience. There are several posters that covered the play-by-play, I chose not to cover the event from that angle. I met some great people, I had some great conversations, and it was an amazing experience.

I'm sure the organizers are relaxing since this afternoon having completed what had to be an enormous amount of preparation to pull off an event of this scale. The logistics were flawless and the format was beyond explanation. You guys did an incredible job on the crucial inception of ALT.NET as a mindset.

Open Spaces is powerful, surprising, awakening, and enlightening. You can't explain it, you just have to do it.

More to come, for now, I remain...

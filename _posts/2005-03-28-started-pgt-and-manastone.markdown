Started a couple more heritage quests -- these will likely take a while. Since it's hit or miss to complete the SBH and the Mask, I've started a couple more quests to get them to the choke (read: willing group) points.

Of course, I have to learn to speak Giant before I can start the PGT, but that hasn't stopped me from foresting a trunkload of trees to find that severed fir for the shank of the axe. 

The WoW boys are having a ball as well, may need to hook up with them tonight to get into the early teens. They're all pretty stoked about it, so I figure I'll give that game some more play time as well.

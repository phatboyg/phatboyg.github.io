I got the fir stave made and killed the skeletons, so I'm moving along nicely in the quest. Another trip back to TS and another couple of steps and I should be done!

Also, played WoW with the guys tonight, pretty fun, but need to seriously work on group tactics. It seems like a crap shoot at the moment with no real organization -- which sucks when there are 3-4 mobs on you at a time.

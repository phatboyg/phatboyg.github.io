No, this is not the start of a series, but the first of at least one tip of the day for Windows users switching to the Mac. By default, OS X does not tab to controls that are not edit-style controls (you know, where you type words and stuff). On Windows, you can tab to anything. I'm a keyboard jockey, so I like to type username (tab) password (tab) (space) to trigger the submit button. Bam! Move along. When I first started using OS X, I was stifled by the mouse requirement. Until I found this dialog under System Preferences...

Once I had this setting changed, the world was all good again. Enjoy!

Monday was patch day and a lot of bad results. Mostly my character is broken because it is impossible to keep my debuffs from graying out due to the concentration resist bug. Until it's fixed, I'm playing my WoW character. I just found out some of my friends also have WoW so I'll likely be creating a new toon to join up with them.

Hopefully EQ2 will be fixed soon. As of right now, there are a ton of upset customers over the lack of quality in the recent releases.

NOTE: Patch Day for WoW was worse as I couldn't even login once I got the patch. And once I did, the server crashed an hour later.

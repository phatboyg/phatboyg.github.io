Last night most of the guild was in The Eternal Forge of the Ages making Wurmsteel weapons so I spent the time catching up on some quests (access and other). I finished the access quest for Nek Castle (epic) and managed to sneak in a little XP at the same time. I also worked on the heritage quests in EF/LS to try and get those moving. Hopefully I can get some action tonight (but I have to work late, so who knows). It's a holiday weekend coming up so I'm sure attendence will be spotty at best.

We did SotL again tonight, we spent a total of seven hours in the zone it seems (almost anyway). We got fourteen (yes, 14!) master chests with a ton of great loot including several server discoveries (see breastplate shot below).

This raid continues to be my favorite without question. We also took down the watcher this time and the associated mobs, but we ran out of time when Venekor was the only thing still standing. Oh well, maybe next time.

I was given the gloves and I show the breastplate only because it was newly discovered.

The [Dallas Code Camp ](http://www.dallascodecamp.com/)is going on today, starting in one hour. This is a single-day event where developers in the area get together and learn from each, talking 100% pure code. No powerpoints, no boring lecture, just pure code. I'm looking forward to attending a few of the sessions, in particular one dealing with the move from ASP -> .NET and another on asynchronous web services to improve scalability. After the break, I'll look forward to a session on the Microsoft Enterprise Library and end with a session on building middle-tier components in .NET.

I'll have some pictures of the event later since I don't have any way to transfer the images from the camera to the PC.

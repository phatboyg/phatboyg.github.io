I can't recall right off where I found this, but the new tool from Microsoft called [Microsoft Live Writer](http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=4372c8c2-b76f-4d44-aea1-9835b61d8dc1) is pretty damn slick. It is an offline editor for your blog. You get an interactive interface, it works with Wordpress (and other tools) and makes it easy to add images and such to your entries. It even uses your style sheet so you can see in advance what the results will look like.

Of course, it doesn't make up for lowsy writing style or grammer, which really hurts me. But it does allow you to keep drafts and some other cool stuff. This post was written using the tool, so if you're reading it things must have gone well!

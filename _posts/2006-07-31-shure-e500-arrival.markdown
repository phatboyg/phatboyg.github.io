Well, they're here and they are very impressive. I'm surprised at the improvement compared to the e4c, I didn't expect them too be such an improvement.

The sound is less congested, bass is greatly improved, treble is brighter and more defined, everything that I grew to dislike when comparing my e4c to my previous Beyerdynamic DT-880's is now gone. Soundstage is wide, the treble my god is so much better.

I'm very happy so far, I've listened to Shpongle, Ott, Barenaked Ladies, Collective Soul and some various artists and I can't complain yet. Rock music is drastically improved over the e4c, which felt lifeless with rock but very good with electronica. I haven't heard anything yet on the e500 that has disappointed me.

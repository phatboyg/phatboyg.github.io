Having switched to the Mac, I find myself in need of a replacement for the very good Windows Live Writer. The first program I tried was Ecto, and I could not dig it. The interface was clunky, it didn't offer any sort of decent preview automatically, and I generally didn't like it.

After Ecto, I tried using TextMate to create and post blog entries. Basically, that's not what the application is for -- it's an editor. So the handshaking and interaction felt contrived and basically it was a demo of how crazy a bundle can get in TextMate. In short, it wasn't happening.

Now I'm trying [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) -- the new version 2 has been released. So far it seems to have a practical user interface that I can appreciate. I'll continue to work with it for the next week to see how it works out. At this point, it feels good. I only hope that it can continue to impress or I'll be searching again...

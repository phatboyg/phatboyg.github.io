Wow, today is going to be a long one. Last night, I went to see [EOTO](http://www.myspace.com/eotomusic) play. EOTO is a spin-off of the now defunct [String Cheese Incident](http://www.stringcheeseincident.com/). It was a solid 2-hour techno show, but not the hard house or trance that I've heard so much about. It was more trip-hop or something like that, very cool stuff. The drummer played for two hours straight without a break -- pretty wild.

The [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) continues to evolve. Post [Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) install I've gotten all my development tools installed, including [Resharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), [TestDriven.NET](http://testdriven.net/), [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/), and [NAnt](http://nant.sourceforge.net/). So far everything seems to be working great. I've yet to install [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/powershell) (so I can have my NIX command-line goodness for the Windows box). I pulled down the trunk of [Castle](http://www.castleproject.org/) and got it to build as well. I had to create the Test & Test2 databases on my local instance of SQL Server 2005 in order for all the tests to complete.

It looks like I'll be giving a presentation on MonoRail at the [TulsaTechFest 2007](http://www.tulsatechfest.com/). It will be an introduction to building a web site using MonoRail and [Brail](http://wiki.castleproject.org/index.php/MonoRail:Brail). MonoRail is part of the Castle Project and provides a [MVC](http://java.sun.com/blueprints/patterns/MVC.html) (model-view-controller) framework within ASP.NET. MVC is a solid pattern for building web applications that is a significant improvement over the page-based WebForms model. MonoRail embraces web standards allows applications to be built based on controller logic and helps facilitate the separation of concerns. It's good stuff, I can't wait ot talk about it.

Did I mention that I'm old and staying out until 2 AM at a live show is painful the next day? Where is the Tylenol again? Strange that I can stay up until 3 AM playing with a new computer and not feel fried the next day but this was... different.

Oh yeah, [Peggle Extreme](http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&AppId=3483) is part of the pre-order package for [TeamFortress2](http://orange.half-life2.com/tf2.html) on Steam. I highly recommend it as a fun diversion! Speaking of TF2, I'm all set for the beta that starts on Monday. I can't wait to play the game, I hope for some cool in-game video recording (with [FRAPS](http://www.fraps.com/) or otherwise) next week. I wonder if voice-chat is built into the game? Things I don't know -- they are plentiful today it seems.

I got my [iPhone store credit](http://www.apple.com/iphone/storecredit/), $100, fast and easy from Apple. I guess this means a trip to the [Apple store](http://www.apple.com/retail/) is coming soon.

Oh, and today's post is an experiment in link diarrhea to see how long it takes this post to go up!

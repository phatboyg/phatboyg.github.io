After dropping Vox, our guild went through Maj'Dul and spawned the silver and gold dragons. After a couple of tries, both of them each met their death and loot was awesome. I got a sweet pair of Golden Dragon Scale Gloves -- with a ton of STR/AGI on them and like 349 mitigation. Very nice. We then went to Poet's to finish out the Djinn Master quest and people got their rewards. A nice dual wield shortsword with 44.4 damage was one of the choices, pretty slick stuff.

Of course, the quest goes on...

Those dragons were bad ass, I can't wait to fight them both at the same time!

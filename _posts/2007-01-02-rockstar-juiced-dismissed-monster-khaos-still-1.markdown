Over the weekend, I picked up a Rockstar Juiced to give it a taste. It's a juice-based drink like Monster Khaos, but it has more of a passion fruit flavor to it instead of the orange flavor of Khaos. I wasn't really impressed with the taste, a bit tart, and not easy to drink. The caffeine content is higher (160 versus 140 for Khaos), but it didn't seem to have the same overall energy kick.

In the end, I dismissed it as an also-ran that isn't available in 4-packs for $6 at Wal-Mart. I'll continue with my Khaos consumption for now.

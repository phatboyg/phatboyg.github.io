Well, it seems that the first four hours of 24 Season 6 are already on the loose. Fox is apparently going to release a DVD on the Tuesday after the premiere that includes the first four episodes. Perhaps they are trying to convince people to avoid downloading a HD-ripped version on the air date, who knows. I just know that it's nice to see the shows becoming available so quickly.

The first two hours showed up on the Scheduled Recordings page of the DVR today too.

Oh, and I don't want to spoil it for you, but Jack Bauer isn't dead yet.

Yeah, the first of the two major holidays are winding down. I've been playing some, but not a lot. I'm working on the quest to get the Amulet of the Swords of Ro, a very nice neck item. It's a huge chain of quests in DoF and it takes a lot of time, but the reward is pretty sweet.

I'm still working towards the Peacock quest too, but I'm on a pretty hard step to solo and hoping for others to catch up so we can do it together. 

Oh, and one other note, going into Cazel's without a cleric is a waste of time!

[Check out this hilarious video for TeamFortress 2](http://www.gametrailers.com/gamepage.php?id=3034)!

In my days of twitch gaming, TeamFortress (QuakeWorld) was my absolute favorite game. We used to play every day for hours and had a pretty hard core clan (PPD - Pay Per Death) the competed in a weekly gaming league. We rocked ass, even went toe-to-toe with Clan Braveheart. Those were some fun days and certainly the most interesting game play I've ever seen in an FPS.

The TFC for Half Life was a weak-ass copy of the game and didn't have the pulse of the original. This one looks seriously awesome and I might even have to dust off the old teflon mouse pad to see if I can still snake a newb from across the map.

The best part about this video? It's my least favorite map, 2fort4!

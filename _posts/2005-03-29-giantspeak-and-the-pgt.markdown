Well, I finished the remaining idols last night and learned to speak giant. I got the Tarby lost quest, completed it and started the PGT. I got all the granite pieces and now I just need a severed fir and somebody to make it into a fir stave for the axe. Then it's a quick combine, 100 skeletons, 25 gnolls and an Octogorgon. :)

This version adds a few new features:



	
  * Load/Save Games

	
  * Restart Game (clears all selected numbers)

	
  * Create custom game
This feature lets you place a custom grid into the game. You first select Game, Create and are presented with an empty grid. At that point, you place all the numbers for the grid. After you are done, you select Game, Create again (unchecking it) and the placed numbers are marked as givens. At that point, the game is ready for play (and available on the network if you have network support enabled).


Enjoy!

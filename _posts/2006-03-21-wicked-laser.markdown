Well, I managed to obtain a laser from [Wicked Lasers](http://www.wickedlasers.com/index.php?promo=4614) yesterday. Shipping was extremely fast, particularly from China.

So far, it's meeting the advertised expectations. I'm still experimented before I get to the final review, but what I've seen so far is impressive. Bursting balloons at four feet, burning holes in dark paper at two inches, highlighting objects in the sky (stars, storm clouds) at night, all of these are easily within the capabilities of the WL unit (55mw). Now, maybe I just got a really good sample so your mileage may vary.

If you want to learn more about the units and the capabililities (as well as the dangers, you have been warned) of these high-powered laser units, check our the forums at [forum.wickedlasers.com](http://forum.wickedlasers.com/) for more information.

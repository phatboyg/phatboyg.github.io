A quick group and a couple of hours later, I've finished the Evil Eye Bag Heritage quest! The regular crew (Ida, Sieve, Rhat, Zinger, Konly) with special guest Grumpie managed to start and complete the entire Evil Eye Bag heritage quest last night. A nice 50,000 status points (not enough for that level 3 keg yet, but close), a few gold and a sweet 30% off 20 slot bag!

Nobody died, it was actually a pretty smooth quest even though all the mobs were 37+ and the final boss was a 40^^. Yoshi helped out with the last part which went flawless!

I was reading lately about DECT, the GSM-style technology for cordless telephones. This technology comes from Europe (Britain if I'm reading it right) and takes advantage of the methods used by GSM (which is almost all mobile networks around the world) to improve the cordless phone quality. It also avoids interference with wireless networks since it operates at 1900 MHz.

Seems like some pretty promising stuff. You can read more about DECT at the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECT).

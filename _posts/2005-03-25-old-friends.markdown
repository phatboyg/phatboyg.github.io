While working on the Dwarven Workboots quest last night, I ran into Moruk on Kithicor. After a quick tell, I found out that Moruk is the same Moruk that was on The Rathe in EQlive. It was fun to find out that some of my old friends from EQlive are now playing EQ2 and on the same server. Freijo is another old friend, but alas, his web profile is not visible. :(

Took the night off last night, so I figured I would post something that I've been saving for a while. 

Are you wondering if you're addicted to online gaming? Here's a quick test to see how you stack up. For each question, select an answer from the following choices and add the points to your total:



	
  1. Rarely

	
  2. Occasionally

	
  3. Frequently

	
  4. Often

	
  5. Always



**Questions:**



	
  1. How often do you find that you play longer than you intended?

	
  2. How often do you neglect household chores to spend more time playing?

	
  3. How often do others in your life complain to you about the amount of time you spend playing?

	
  4. How often do you check official/fan sites for updates to the game?

	
  5. How often does your job performance or productivity suffer because of the game?

	
  6. How often do you find yourself surfing for game items, zones or strategies while at work?

	
  7. How often do you find yourself thinking about what you are going to do when you play again?

	
  8. How often do you lose sleep due to late-night gaming sessions?

	
  9. How often do you try to cut down the amount of time you spend playing and fail?

	
  10. How often do you choose to spend more time online instead of going out with others in real-life?

	
  11. Bonus Question (triple points): How often do you spend writing about your game play on a blog or forum?




Add your scores and see where the total falls within the following ranges:

**10-25**
You are an average online gamer, nothing to worry about.

**26-40**
Your are an addicted online gamer.

**41-60**
You are a seriously addicted online gamer, probably a member of a guild and mostly likely are in need of some serious sleep.

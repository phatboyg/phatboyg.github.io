I had completely avoided this show since it started. I had never seen a single episode and just listened as coworkers recapped the amazing things about the show, without actually saying what happened. At least I tuned it out until now.

Last night, I watched the first two episodes of the first season (on DVD). After that mere 88 minutes of content (which is actually two hours in real-time), I'm hooked. Now I just need to find the time to catch up on the remaining 22 hours of the first season to find out what happens!

I saw this in the Tulsa World this morning and the site is pretty slick.

[MetroFreeFi - Tulsa](http://www.metrofreefi.com/free-wifi-Tulsa-OK-USA.htm)

The site allows you to add/update locations in your area that offer free Wi-Fi access. The site has some strong google integration (maps, ads) but ratings, comments, and updates seemed to appear quickly on the site. I ran through a few of camping sites I've used, and I think some of them are wrong but I want to verify before I update the site (for instance, it shows the Doubletree as free and I'm pretty sure they are pay via Wayport).

It's a pretty useful resource if you're traveling and need to pick up mail, game, whatever when you get stuck in a hotel with lame service.

While I've been working to help the guild tradeskillers by harvesting as much T6 as I can, I've been working on the quests to gain faction with the Court of Blades. I haven't had too much trouble so far, but I've yet to solo anything even close to white, let alone yellow. I need to find some good action to see what happens as a result. The scenery in Sinking Sands is very nice, and Maj'Dul is well done. I've been to a few pretty slick zones (Pillars of Flame and the Shimmering Citadel), some of which are more frustrating than others. The more interesting facts seem to indicate that there is a Plane of Sky in this expansion. I keep reading about it from NPC chatter and the indications are strong that we may actually have our first plane in EQ2!

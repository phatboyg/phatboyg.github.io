We started rounding up the required shards for the Fire and Ice quest to Rez Vox. We hope to get the next round of prismatics done before the DoF launch. Once a couple of members hit 49 we'll likely start Deception and make the run for Darathar again.

We also did Meeting of the Minds last night and it sure was interesting. Our tank went from full to nothing in a matter of seconds, likely the result of some lag or something since he was getting hit for less than the reactives heal for, so who knows. Anyway, we spent the next few minutes getting enough people revived to clean up all the adds and get things reset. As a nice bonus, we got a metal chest for our efforts that was **packed** will treats for the guild.

Frogs tonight, fun. :)

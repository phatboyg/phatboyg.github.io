I feel like I'm a permanent resident of Rivervale with as much time as I've been spending there harvesting for lost gold, er, ebon. I've found a lot of rares, but no ebon yet. Hopefully I can wrangle an ebon cluster or rough ruby soon so I can get some upgrades made for use on raids.

Other than that, not a whole lot else going on this weekend. I'm hoping to make the froglok raid tonight, those are always a blast!

I've been putting some time in to the UI design on the site. The first revision is now online. I hope you like the new look as much as I've enjoyed creating it. WordPress is pretty flexible, but there are some limitations. Overall I'm very happy with it as a publishing system for general blogging.

Stay tuned for some new user interface updates, including a landing pad for some of my favorite RSS feeds and a player information page.

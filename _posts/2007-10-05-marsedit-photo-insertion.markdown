So MarsEdit interfaces with Flickr, making it easy to add pictures from the iPhone into a blog post. So I'm going to see just how well it works. Note, this is only a test! The picture is of me at my 20th high school reunion this past summer holding one of my daughters.

It looks like MarsEdit is a keeper, but I need more time with it before I pull the trigger.

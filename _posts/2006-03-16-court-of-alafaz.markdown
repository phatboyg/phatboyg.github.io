We did this zone last night. I was late and almost missed it, we're doing this zone in less than 90 minutes now it seems. We've just about looted it out, but it's good coin for the guild bank and even better guild XP on the rush to 50. After that, we helped some guildies with the Mark of the Awakened quest by zoning into Halls of Fate and then the Trials of Awakening. There are a few critical bugs in this zone, but we understand how to work around them now and can hopefully take it down the next time we visit the place. The trick is having four people on the quest at the same spot to get the orbs to spawn.

Tonight we start raiding T7, so that should be VERY interesting. We'll see how it goes!

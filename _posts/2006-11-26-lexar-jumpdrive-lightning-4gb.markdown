I'm seriously considering one of these to replace my slow ass molasses 2GB PNY Attache drive. The Lexar Lightning seems to run right at the top of the speed charts, and includes the cool application launch software as well. I was nervous at first, but after reading these benchmarks, I think the case is closed:

I'll let you know once I have it how well it performs, but I'm guessing it is a huge upgrade to what I have today.

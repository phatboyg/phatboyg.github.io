This zone continue to be the flavor of the month. Not only is it new, but many have said it is the best thing to happen to EQ2. Who is to say, but I am having a ton of fun with it. I just hope I can get my shard to come back before the next call to arms by the guild. That way, I can go back easily for more action.

I hope to finish the remaining quests in there, it seems like they are repeatable as well so that's a plus as many have great rewards and some even have the change to drop master chests so that's a bonus as well. A master chest for a solo player? WoW.

My 2001 MR2 Spyder returned to the garage today. It had been out for nearly a month getting a new engine after the original one took a turd on itself. Strangely there wasn't much to see, a new block and exhaust assembly (including that fresh new catalytic converter smell) don't make for any real eye candy. But it worked and made it home just fine.

I'm going to have to throw a few hundred miles on it before I put it up for sale to make sure it's solid, but it did come with a 12-month, unlimited miles warranty on the motor swap. And it is transferable so the buyer will be feeling safe about that. Nothing like a 37,000 mile car with all the engine guts replaced. Of course, it wasn't a nice summer day so the drive home wasn't as great as it could have been.

Funny thing after driving the Subaru STI while it was in the shop, the Spyder doesn't seem to have the powerful engine feeling it did before it went into the shop. Of course, the power feels fine it's just no match for the strength of the STI engine. :)

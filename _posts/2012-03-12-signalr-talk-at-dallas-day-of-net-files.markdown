If you attended my presentation at the Dallas Day of .NET on SignalR, the source for the demo is available below.




The demo uses SignalR, ASP.NET MVC, and MassTransit to communicate between an external service (the console app), the web site, and the browser application, showing how an end-to-end solution with back-end events being published out to the browser could be accomplished.

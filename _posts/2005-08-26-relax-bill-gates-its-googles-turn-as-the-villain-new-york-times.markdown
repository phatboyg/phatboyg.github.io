[Relax, Bill Gates; It's Google's Turn as the Villain - New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/technology/24valley.html?ei=5090&en=344e9c533c3980cc&ex=1282536000&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all)

I found this article interesting in how Google has become the new Borg, replacing Microsoft. Will this garner sympathy for Microsoft? I doubt it, but it certainly has implications on the entire industry like previous companies in such a high profile position.

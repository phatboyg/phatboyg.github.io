Well, less than a week on the expansion and I'm at level 62 so far. The grind isn't too bad with all the stuff there is to do with the expansion, so that's a good thing. I actually went around the old zones and got a ton of new discovery experience (I swear I'd been there before though). I'm up to 5 APs, but I think I'm going to have to change my choices, what I have so far totally sucks. In fact, they all suck for dirges, but hopefully they'll change them and allow us to remake our choices again.

I've gotten a few nice gear drops and I have four of my new spells. Unfortunately, many of them are not upgrades compared to the Master I versions of the previous spell, so until I get some rare gems, I won't be upgrading any spells for the time being.

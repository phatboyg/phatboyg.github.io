Was playing last night in Splitpaw and managed to sneak up on level 48 before I logged. Harclave was bugged, but I didn't realize it until the end that I never got a quest update. Oh well, I leveled but two hours down the drain.

I read the post today that indicates which events have to be completed in order to get your port shard. I've done Trial of Harclave and the crawler group instance, so now I just need to finish the bombing run (Prank) and hopefully that will give me my shard. I'm SO tired of going through the upper tunnels just to get into the den -- I've done it way too many times now.

I am officially out of adventure XP vitality, so 48 is going to be one seriously slow level! Based on my current rate of experience, I should be level 50 in a couple of weeks.

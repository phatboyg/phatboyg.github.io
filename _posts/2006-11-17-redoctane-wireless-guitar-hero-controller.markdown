My pre-order for the official Red Octane wireless controller for Guitar Hero (and Guitar Hero II) came in yesterday. In short, it works great. The range is excellent and it works with both games (unlike the off-brand controllers that were locked out of GH2 action). It's a white guitar and the buttons seem to be slightly deeper than the regular unit, but it could just be me. I'm still breaking it in so the action is a bit stiff, but it works great and I never miss a note (well, except that I suck and miss them all the time, but it is not the fault of the controller).

It was only $60 (I got mine at GameStop, next to Wings-To-Go on Riverside) and well worth the investment. Now I have three guitars and have yet to start a multiplayer game! Argh!

The guild did some old world raids tonight, including Venekor, MotM, Zek, Antonica. A total of five master chests with some usuable gear and some 47+ master spells. Not a bad haul considering the relative ease of these raids now compared to T6 raids.

Need to get more folks online earlier so we can work on T6 raids as well! :)

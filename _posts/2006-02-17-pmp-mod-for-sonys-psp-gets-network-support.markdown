A clever programmer has added network support to the PMP Mod video player for Sony's PSP.

You must have a 1.5 firmware version Playstation Portable to use this program. The program is clearly in its infancy, so the faint of heart might want to wait for an official release from the original developer. I'm not knocking Optixx, I just think the server-side software needs some tuning to make it more platform agnostic.

While this is slick, I'd really like to see the ability to save your last-viewed position in a video file so that I can return to CSI Miami where I left off. :)

Looks like the new iPods are out. With a new 2.5" color screen and a thinner profile, the new iPods look pretty sweet. They also improved the battery life. Kudos to Apple for hooking up with ABC (hopefully more networks soon) to offer episodes online after they air for those that don't have time to stay glued to the TV set.

You can find out more at [Apple](http://www.apple.com/ipod/).

In a minor product update today, Apple released four new colors for the iPod Shuffle. The tiny 1GB player is now available in blue, green, orange, pink, and the original silver. Now if they would only release a new 16GB Nano in all those same colors. With the freefall price of flash memory lately, it shouldn't cost a dime over the price of the current 8GB unit ($249).

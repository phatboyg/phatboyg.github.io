Looks like another installment of the great Guitar Hero franchise is coming next month!

[Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero_Encore:_Rocks_the_80s)

It's only for the PS2, but I would bet the XBOX 360 version gets the option to buy the songs as downloads over XBOX LIVE.

Okay, I have the original Mercury Radio version and the original movie version.

Hell, I even have Jeff Wayne's audio remake, disco overtones and all.

But the Spielberg version with Tom Cruise is the absolute worst film I have seen in the past few years. It was freaking horrible and a complete waste of time. I pity those that actually bought the disc.

So, again, the 2005? remake of War of the Worlds is absolute crap and a waste of time. Seriously, the younger generation needs to watch the original, weak special effects and all, and get a glimpse of the real story. Or better yet, sit back, turn out the lights, load a copy of the original on your iPod, and listen to what freaked a nation 73 years ago while listening to their radios.

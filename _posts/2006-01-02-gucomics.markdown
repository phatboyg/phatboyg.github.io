It's a new year at GUComics and Woody has some changes planned. I go to this site almost every day hoping to see what new humor has been cooked up. It's a great cartoon for those in the video game world. He routinely beats down WoW, EQ2, EQ and any company that tries to fling poo at the general gamer public.

I highly recommend it as a regular read: [GUComics](http://www.gucomics.com/)

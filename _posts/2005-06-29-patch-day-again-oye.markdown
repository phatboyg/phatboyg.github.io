Once again SOE has proven that they can roll out a mess of bugs with a major update. Zones were crashing constantly, but not to the point where you died, because the zone crashed it just put you back when it came back up (which was quick). The only part that sucked is the re-entry timers were updated so when raid zones crashed, you were basically screwed for another day+.

Because of this, most of the guild made it an early night (likely to catch up on some sleep), as did I when I passed out while putting my daughter to bed while AFK in EF. :)

_Also, rumor has it that Sieve logged in last night and found himself lying naked near the Freeport Station griffon tower. I have no idea, but it must have been one hell of a party!_**

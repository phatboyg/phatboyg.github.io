Okay, I think I have a problem. I can't stop doing grifter quests. There is just something fun about them that never gets old. Maybe it's the "canned hunt" feel of the entire thing, but when I see "Hedging our Bets" in the quest journal, I get excited!

Level 57 last night, I haven't checked the timeframe but I'm guessing it's pretty close to 3-4 days as the last few levels.

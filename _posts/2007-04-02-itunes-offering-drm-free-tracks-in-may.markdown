[According to Apple Insider](http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=2623), the iTunes Music Store will start offering higher quality tracks for download (256-kbit AAC) without DRM protection for $1.29 each. This minor increase in price is more than acceptable given the improved quality of the higher bit rate. It appears that only EMI is on board so far, but expect more to follow as the possibility of increased revenues is too hard to ignore.

Last night, within the first twelve hours of the EverQuest II Echoes of Faydwer release, Mob Squad was the first guild to hit the new guild level 60. The hard work of the guild with some last minute raids pushed us over the top and made it happen! Grats to all those that got worldwide first discovery on all the new horses and the Countesses in our guild (sorry, not sure of the male title).

So much for making it 'much more difficult' to obtain guild levels in this release. Well, they did make it harder, that's for sure, but it wasn't impossible.

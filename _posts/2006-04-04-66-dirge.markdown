After a seriously busy couple of weeks, I got some time and ground out level 66. I got a couple of new spells, the major of which is an upgrade to Clara's. For once, even the Adept I of the new spell is better than the Adept 3 of the previous tier. Not much, but something. With rough moonstone still around 5p a piece, it's going to be a while before I see any Adept 3 upgrades for 61-70 spells.

I hit level 45 last night while working on the heritage quests in Lavastorm. Actually grouped with some folks in the guild and managed to get quite a bit of progress made (if you don't count those damn banners).

I also updated my signature code to include some additional guild details and tweaked the format a bit. You can see it here:

I also made some changes to my user interface last night. I swapped out a number of old mods for new ones that are slicker and I've rearranged my layout to be more left/right balanced. As a result, I get even more visible area with less vertical crunching. I'll post a screenshot and the archive in a few days.

We had a fun night last night, despite another crazy night in Splitpaw: Anvilpaw's Grotto.

I can't remember the order, but we did Antonica (passed on Lich), Drayek, Angler and tried to do Splitpaw but one of the groups wiped and you can't bring new members into the zone due to the gates. For the life of me, I can't remember the other zone we did last night, but I know we did something else.

Got some much needed loot for some members of the guild, and we got a couple of new members last night as well!

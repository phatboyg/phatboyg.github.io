Okay, this is in the seriously cool zone. I was working in Visual Studio, when I did a check for updates. It showed that a new video driver for the 6800 Ultra was available (released mid-December). So I figured, what the heck, I could use the FPS, go ahead and install it.

I went about my business in VS2005, working on a project, when the screen blinked to black. I waited a few seconds, then it came back on. I figured it was the driver update being applied and that it was now time to reboot. What? Install successful? No reboot required?

Too damn cool! I gotta give props here MS, that's a seriously way-cool feature.

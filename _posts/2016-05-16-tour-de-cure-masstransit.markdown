TL;DR: [Help Reach My Goal](http://main.diabetes.org/goto/phatboyg) - or exceed it and get a day of MassTransit training for your organization (see below)!

## Introduction

As most people reading this blog know, _MassTransit_ is a free, open-source service bus, and used by hundreds (at least) of organizations across the world to build event-based applications on .NET. And most probably realize that 
MassTransit is built entirely for free, without any corporate support at all. It is a labor of love, and while often challenging, makes for a great _hobby_ if you consider a framework at the core of multi-million dollar projects something that could be considered a "hobby."

And some of you may have seen talks that I have given at various technology conferences. If you have, I hope that it was informational and provided value on how to build loosely coupled systems. I truly enjoy working on MassTransit, and helping others learn about the patterns and methods for building systems using it are incredibly valuable to me.

## Diabetes, and the Tour de Cure

On May 1st, I rode in the Napa Valley Tour de Cure -- a 50+ mile ride through wine country, to raise money for the American Diabetes Association. My own contribution, $125, was matched by McKesson (my employer) for a total of $250. It was a beautiful day, and a great ride, but I really wanted to give more to support the organization.

So I'm riding again, this time in Oklahoma (my home state), on June 4th. I'll be covering a 70 mile route and this time, I want to raise _more_ to help the ADA. I'm already covering the cost of travel, and my initial donation of $200 to meet the ride minimum.

This is where I'm asking for help.

## How you can help!

If you've enjoyed one of my previous speaking engagements, are using MassTransit commercially, or are just a fan and would love to help out, you can make a donation on [My Tour Page](http://main.diabetes.org/goto/phatboyg).

Your donations have a huge impact, and help shape the future of diabetes. Having Type 2 diabetics in my family, I see the effects directly, so your support is greatly appreciated.

## One Day On-Site MassTransit Training

Okay, this is something I'm offering, to a commercial organization that wants to bring me, personally, on site for a day of hands-on training with their team. I don't offer commercial support for MassTransit, but I have spent a day or two with organization to help them learn and understand how to use MassTransit in their company. With this opportunity, we can spend a day together and explore the options for your development team to gets deep into message-based applications!

By making a $2,500 donation on my behalf, I will spend one day with your team building a hands-on understanding of how to maximize your use of MassTransit! There are only _TWO_ of these available, and the first two companies that donate will be accepted.

> Note that any travel expenses from San Francisco will need to be covered by the company as well, fair and reasonable, shouldn't be more than flight and a night or two of lodging -- I'm fairly frugal in this respect. And at this time, I need to limit this to the continental US.

I highly recommend contacting me first, to save your place in line, and then submit your contribution. That way I can confirm that one of the two spots are available. Once confirmed, you can use [My Tour Page](http://main.diabetes.org/goto/phatboyg) to complete your contribution. The actual on-site date would need to occur after July 1st.

If you just want to say thank you, for the framework in general, a question that may have been answered (sadly Stack Overflow points don't generate actual revenue), or for help you may have received via email, any contribution amount would be appreciated at [My Tour Page](http://main.diabetes.org/goto/phatboyg).

## Keep on Busing

Thank you to all that are using and enjoying MassTransit. It's great to have a project that is so broadly used, and your feedback and suggestions are welcome and encouraging!

My cleric is now up to 12 and moving along nicely. It's amazing how fast the levels come at the early part of the game. The sad part is I haven't even grouped yet -- maybe once I hit 20 more people will be doing groups. Or maybe I just need to get to the point of going into BlackBurrow or something more dangerous.

Soloing isn't too bad though, I can heal myself, I can chain cast HOs and my proc's come in handy at times too. I need to get all my spell upgrades though, I've put off buying Apprentice II because I want to make a slew of App IV/Adepts to really give her that extra kick in groups.

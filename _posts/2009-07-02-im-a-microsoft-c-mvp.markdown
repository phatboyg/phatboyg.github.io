Opening my Inbox this morning resulted in a pleasant surprise from Microsoft. I have been presented with the 2009 MicrosoftÂ® MVP Award as a recognition for sharing my expertise in Visual C# with others. It is an honor to be recognized by Microsoft for doing something that I truly enjoy - building really cool software.

_Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs) are exceptional technical community leaders from around the world who are awarded for voluntarily sharing their high quality, real world expertise in offline and online technical communities. Microsoft MVPs are a highly select group of experts that represents the technical community's best and brightest, and they share a deep commitment to community and a willingness to help others._







A community-based award like this would not be possible without the support of my peers, and I look forward to meeting up with some of those very peers at the next MVP Summit! In the meantime, congratulations to all the new and renewed MVPs!

Today I was honored for the second time with the Microsoft MVP award. It's great to be recognized for my efforts in the .NET community over the past year. The next year is already shaping up to be another great one, with upcoming speaking engagements at Dallas TechFest, Devlink (Nashville, TN), St. Louis Day(s, plural) of .NET, and the Heartland Developers Conference in Omaha, NE.

If you are near any of these great events, I hope you are able to attend, learn a few things, and most importantly meet others that are part of the software development community. I also would encourage you to attend a few sessions outside of your regular development platform to get an idea of how other technologies solve the same problems in their own way. The cost to value of all these events is an absolute bargain, and many have early registration discounts that are only good for a limited time, so be sure to get registered to ensure the best price.

I look forward to meeting some of you over the next few months, so if you are at one of my talks or see me in the hall, be sure to introduce yourself and give a shout out.

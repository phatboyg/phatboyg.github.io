I'm posting this mostly for me, but as a general piece of information, this offers a good explanation of how bass works in a sedan. In my old Honda (search the articles), the trunk and passenger compartment were sealed off from each other as show in figure 4. This prevented the cancellation of sound waves shown in the previous figures.

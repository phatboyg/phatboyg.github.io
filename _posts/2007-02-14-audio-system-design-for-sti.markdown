In considering the design for an audio system in the STI, I've come across of a couple of pretty slick items. Space is obviously a concern, since having a trunk means learning to use the trunk. Fiberglass is obviously a nice choice considering the reduced weight compared to wood. Audio Integrations makes a couple of really slick items for the car:

A [12" Subwoofer Enclosure](http://www.audiointegrations.citymax.com/catalog/item/3182186/2719558.htm) and an [Amplifier Rack](http://www.audiointegrations.citymax.com/catalog/item/3182186/3580160.htm), both designed specifically for the car.

OMG what a fun game. I would type more about it, but I can't move my fingers.

Okay, fingers work again. I picked up this game yesterday and could not put it down. I started off on medium (because easy would be for wimps, right?) and cranked through a couple of songs before I realized there had to be more to it. So I ran through the tutorials, which were pretty remedial at this point, so I went back to the songs and tried again. I was starting to get the hang of it, putting some rhythm with the song is really important. Now, once I realized that you cannot play a guitar sitting on the couch, I attached the strap and stood up for some serious rock and roll!

Now, I had previously played the game only once before, and that was at Best Buy in their gamers section. My daughter was with me and having fun watching me. That was when I realized that I was having a little too much fun in the game section and was probably close to ending up on America's Funniest Home Videos if I kept it up. So, with a slight reluctance, I laid down my plastic axe and went to the next display. But in the back of my mind, I knew that I wanted to just keep "rocking to it."

So, fast forward to the present and here I am about half way through the medium setting. Now some of the songs I really got hung up on the solos, so I need to work on that a bit. But the gameplay is fun and it's easy to find yourself reliving those air guitar moments from the 70's and 80's. I mean, it's pretty serious fun, just search YouTube for some videos and you'll see what I mean. I can't imagine how a few guys and a few beers combined with this game would result, but I guarantee it would be worth filming and sharing with the world. We're talking some serious Guys Gone Stupid trying to immitate everyone from Black Sabbath to Incubus on the air stage.

I've read that with the next version, Guitar Hero II, you'll be able to multiplayer different parts of the song: lead, rhythm or bass guitar. That would be awesome. I'm trying to figure out how to get a multiplayer jam going with just two people, but it seems you can't just buy a second controller, you have to get the whole combo again so that's probably not going to happen soon. A Guitar Hero LAN Party? I'm not sure I could imagine such a thing by itself, but it sure beats the hell out of Trivial Pursuit for guest entertainment.

So keep on rockin' me baby... :)

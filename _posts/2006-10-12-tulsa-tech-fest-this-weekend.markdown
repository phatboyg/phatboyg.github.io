The [Tulsa Tech Fest ](http://www.tulsatechfest.com/)is this Saturday at the OSU-Tulsa campus. If you are in the Tulsa area and work in software development or IT, you need to attend this event. Details and sign up information are on the official site and it is never too late to register!

I'm going to be giving two talks at the event.

The first is on Advanced JavaScript using Atlas. I'm going to cover a lot of the advanced JavaScript enhancements made available by Atlas and show how some of them can be used to make some cool JavaScript applications.

The second is on Real-Time Communities using AJAX. This talk will be a code dive using AJAX and a collection of server-side technologies to provide a real-time responsive interface for browser-based applications. This new paradigm eliminates polling and puts real-time events back into the browser from the server.

So if you are interested, feel free to attend either session. There are over 100 other sessions to choose from as well, so anything IT related you're going to find something to learn at this event.

It's free, and there is a massive prize vault for attendees so show up and you might win something cool, including an XBOX 360 (which I had to list separately since it's not cool)!

See you there!

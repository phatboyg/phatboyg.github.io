This past weekend, SNL did a parody of Taylor Hicks, the gray haired American Idol contestant known for his wild behavior on stage. Yeah, the boy can sing, but he's been called the drunk dad at a wedding reception along with other similar comments by Simon. He's one of my favorites on the show, so I dug up the skit to take a look. You can watch it [here](http://www.campcreations.com/video/TaylorHicksSNL.wmv).

I'm going to an [MSDN Event](http://www.msdnevents.com/) today, this one is titled:

** Get Connected with the .NET Framework 2.0 and Visual Studio® 2005 (and Beyond)**


These days, it seems like everything's talking. Smart Client applications are sending emails and uploading and downloading files from the Internet. Browsers are talking to Web servers asynchronously. And enterprise systems are using a myriad of Web Services, .NET Remoting, and other technologies to get the job done.

Fortunately, it's easy to keep the conversations flowing with the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0, Visual Studio 2005 and the forthcoming WinFX® platform. In this free half-day event, you'll see the future of writing connected systems by exploring the upcoming Windows Communication Foundation. Check out how easy it is to send mail, work with FTP and HTTP, and detect network availability and status by using the System.Net namespace. And learn how quickly you can create AJAX-style applications by using the powerful new "Atlas" framework.

Session 1: Exploring the System.Net Namespace in the .NET Framework 2.0
Session 2: Windows Communication Foundation Exposed
Session 3: Building the Next Generation of Web Applications with ASP.NET "Atlas"


I'm sure it's going to be good, a lot of fresh information (well, an update at least, they're still talking about the stuff they released at the PDC last fall) and some free swag as well. I'm hoping for at least one free coupon for some popcorn and a drink.

:)

Yes, I'm easy to please.

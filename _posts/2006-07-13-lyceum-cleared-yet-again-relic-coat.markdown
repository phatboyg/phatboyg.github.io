Last night we cleared Lyceum again. Four guilds all went in at the same time so lag was stupid at the start. But it got better towards the end and we finished on a fine victory. I picked up a Relic Chain Coat (that I have to go turn in sometime), which is a nice upgrade from my God King loot I've been nursing since T6.

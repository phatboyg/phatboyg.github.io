This router has been working perfectly since I got it. I've had it for a few months now and it never gets rebooted, always works flawlessly, I get maximum throughput from my cable connection (usually 525 KB/sec on usenet), and I get no lag while playing EQ2, using TeamSpeak and downloading at the same time.

I just upgraded from version 1.3 to version 1.5 of the firmware, so we'll see if that experience changes. Why did I upgrade it? Because the latest version supports some new uPNP features (useful for PSP) and other things that the older did not.

I still highly recommend this as the best router for the home power-user (and any serious gamer) that costs less than $150.

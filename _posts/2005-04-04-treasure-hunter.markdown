Last night, with the help of Sieve, I finished:

Fishbone Earring
Shiny Brass Halberd

While the two-handed halberd is mounted in my room, the earring is an awesome piece to have! It replaced my Gathered Orb of Channeling, which went into my Gathered Orb collection, resulting in a Necklace of Flowing Orbs (which I likely won't use).

Now if I can only get access to the Cove of Decay I can snag the Octogorgon and finish my PGT quest!

Oh, 43 provisioner as well. Can't wait to make some of those stat buff foods to go with my uber-drinks. :)

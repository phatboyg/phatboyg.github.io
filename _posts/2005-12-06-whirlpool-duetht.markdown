Yeah, okay, this is way off base I know. But I bought the new Duet/HT with matching dryer to replace our aging washer/dryer combo (over 12 years old) a couple of days ago and it was installed yesterday. I have to say without a doubt, this is probably the best purchase I've made in a long time. It's slightly more blissful than the KitchenAid dishwasher we bought to replace the original builder-grade Jenn-Air that came with the house.

Okay, come on, showing love for a new washer/dryer?

Absolutely. Forget the fact it's the most energy efficient unit in production. Forget that it can heat your clothes to 153 degrees to eliminate all bacteria. Forget that you can throw a queen size comforter into it (you know, the one you keep saying you'll wash but never do) and have it come out smelling fresh and feeling soft. Never mind that it can wash 16 pairs of jeans or 22 towels. Don't even talk about the 1250 RPM spin speed that makes blankets come out without only a hint of moisture in them.

**It is so quiet, and I mean quiet!**

No more turning up the TV while doing laundry. No more raising voices to be heard over the wash cycle. No more timing loads so that they aren't running during regular living time or when trying to go to sleep. Just load it up and go, no worries.

Yeah, they were expensive, in fact, they were very expensive. But I think the cost is well worth the benefits.

Nothing new on your 30th birthday. I enjoyed the silence.

You did put out a new Mac Mini, pretty reasonable device if you don't want a laptop and don't have demanding system needs. I would get one if it wouldn't clash with my XP network.

Now get out of your chair and throw the real video iPod to the masses. :)

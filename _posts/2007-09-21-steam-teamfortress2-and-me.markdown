So far, the game is a blast. I've only played a couple of evenings (well, three, for a total of eight hours or so) but the game play is pretty darn good. I'm still working on getting some experience with more of the classes, but I'm liking what I see so far. It's a shame there is hardly any team play on public servers, hopefully once the release happens there will be some team leagues starting or something to get some organized action.

Well, we screwed up by having somebody not on the quest examine the shards and we got the hostile version of Vox. So we have to get another set of shards and try again to rez Vox. Not a big deal, we just have to run around and do the shard drakotas again. We should still have time to finish another round of prismatics before DoF launch day.

But the night wasn't a total loss, we got the Steel Golem in Cazic-Thule and now have another Steel Golem heart.

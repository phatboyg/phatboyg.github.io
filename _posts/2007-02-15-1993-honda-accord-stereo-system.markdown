In digging through some old pictures, I came across the pictures of my car audio system from 1994. This was built into a 1993 Honda Accord EX with the sole intention of entering IASCA competitions. While the scene has certainly changed since I was in the game, the sound remains the same. Loud, quality audio systems that reproduce a concert-level music atmosphere.

The system took first in every competition entered, and even took best of show in the 1994 Car Toys season finale. I managed to snag enough points for a nationals invitation, but bought a house and didn't have the funds to compete at the national level.

The system consisted of the following components:



	
  * Alpine In-Dash CD Player

	
  * Alpine 6-Disc CD Changer

	
  * Alpine ???? 7-Band Parametric EQ

	
  * Alpine 3656 Active Dividing Network

	
  * (2) a/d/s/ PQ-10 Amplifiers (bridged to 2x100 for tweeters and midranges, one amp per channel)

	
  * (1) a/d/s/ PQ-20 Amplifier (bridged to 2x200 into the subwoofers)

	
  * Boston Acoustics Pro series 6.5" midrange and 1" tweeter, custom mounted into stock locations

	
  * Clifford Alarm System with Remote Start, Window and Sunroof Automation

	
  * Optima Red Top second battery

	
  * 1F Stiffening Cap

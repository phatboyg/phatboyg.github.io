Well, the keynote is done and the major sites have all the updates. The key products include:

[iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/)
_(Shipping in June)_
Far beyond any expectations, the iPhone was a serious power hit. I mean, this thing is so far beyond what I expected I think anyone else that tries to announce a portable media device is going to just have to crawl in a hole and die. Seriously, nothing is even close.

[iTV](http://www.apple.com/appletv/)
_(Shipping in Feburary)_
Now you can take iTunes beyond the desktop, beyond the laptop, and beyond your pocket. Put it directly on your big screen TV with the new iTV.

[Airport Extreme](http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/)
_(Shipping in Feburary)
_While not officially mentioned, the new network base station to complement today's news.

So far, Mac Mini upgrades to Core 2 Duo, Mac Pro upgrade to Quad Xeon, and a few other expected items are MIA.

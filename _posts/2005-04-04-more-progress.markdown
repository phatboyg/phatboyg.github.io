First, 44 provisioner. :)

Second, I started the progression of quests to gain access to the epic version of the Cove of Decay to complete the PGT. I released the centaurs, killed the nasty gnoll and his group of friends, killed The Banished and now I'm on the step that requires the nasty named by the RoV entrance (died once, and fast at that solo) and need to catch Windfeather up so I can snag him as well. Then I should be able to go in and get that nasty Octogorgon, although I'm sure I'll need some help to get it done. RUMOR is that only one needs access to the zone, but I'm not sure I buy that. Hopefully that's the case or else I'll need to find some others with access to complete the quest.

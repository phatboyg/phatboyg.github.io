Maybe I think this is funny because my daughter watched the second Scooby Doo movie last night (and boy was it dumb, not nearly as good as the original), but this article equating Scooby Doo to the Dukes of Hazzard movie, noting the use of the film in torture at the U.S. detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was pretty funny. I particularly like the part at the end about NASA.

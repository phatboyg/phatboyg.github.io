So, it seems the French government wants to ban iTunes because you can play your songs on a $20 MP3 player you pick up at the corner store. Sure, Apple rules the online music marketplace. And anyone with a small amount of will and a search engine can figure out how to get their iTunes purchases to play on any MP3 player. So what's the big deal? Apple is where it is at because of adequate copyright protection for users who download music from the iTunes Music Store. And publishers use Apple because of their popularity and protection (not to mention the brand buzz, "We're on iTunes, we're hip!").

I guess Apple can reconsider building their "Jerry Lewis" video library on iTMS now since they may be forced to make their site unavailable to his biggest fan base.

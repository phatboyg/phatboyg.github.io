Okay, so, Firefox 1.5 pissed me off for the last time when I had problems using it with the ABC streaming site. Stupid flash support in 1.5.0.2 sucks so it is gone. Enough!

But I needed my tabs, so I put IE7b2 on the game machine (XPS) and gave it a spin. After resetting some registry permissions so that it could be installed correctly, we're up and running. So far, so good. Seems to be fast, stable and has a very useful RSS browser. I'm stoked, no complaints yet.

It even let me specify Google as the default search service. Way to play fair MS.

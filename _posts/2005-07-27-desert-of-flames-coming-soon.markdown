With 50 out of the way, the mode of operation has switched to raids and quests only. I'm trying to get a bunch of heritage quests (for items I won't use) to the point of ready to complete so that I can turn them in when the XP cap is lifted.

I'm also catching up on the stacks and stacks of raw materials I have in the bank, so slaving over the stove is going to be a common gig for me over the next few days as I crunch out those items to make room for more raw materials.

Hopefully the guild will get started on another round of Fire and Ice and Deception soon so I can get my prismatic weapon from Darathar. :)

In the meantime, I've applied for the DoF beta, hopefully I'll get accepted so I can make sure that the new combat changes don't totally gimp us dirges.

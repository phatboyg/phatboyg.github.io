Well, we took a shot at raiding last night. We went into CoD to get the epic x4 version of Rognog, the Angler. We had 22 people (compared to our usual 10-12 for this raid). We won, but it wasn't the cakewalk it was before the patch. In fact, aggro was the biggest problem. I think some classes are nuking **much** harder than before, whereas taunts and such are not generating as much. I think we got more details than that, but I'll leave those for you to experience on your own.

Nonetheless, the easiest raid in the game is reasonably hard now. I'm guessing we'll try Drayek next since he was pretty easy before the patch as well. Or maybe Zek, that wasn't too bad either.

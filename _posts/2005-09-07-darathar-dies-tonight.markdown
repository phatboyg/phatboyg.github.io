Monday night, the guild did a run of the drakotas for deception. We got them all. And afterwards, a few of us went to DFC to get the last ring. So several of us are ready to rock for the Darathar run tonight.  Did I mention the loot dropped by the Deception drakotas is awesome? We got some sweet items, including a very nice bow.

Bring on the prismatics!

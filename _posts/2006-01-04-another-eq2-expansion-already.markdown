Yeah, okay, for most of us the Desert of Flames content is already stale. Most of it has been completed and while some of it was "hard" it wasn't what I would consider "challenging" or "though-provoking" and the itemization took an extra two months to figure out. In fact, the first month was a major bug-fest of unfinished content. Not to say that the bugs are fixed, there are just not enough players left who really care.

Now they're putting out this: [Kingdom of Sky](http://sonyonline.com/corp/press_releases/010306_EQ2KOS.html)

So, it took a year to raise the cap from 50-60 and less than six months to add 60-70 and alternative advancement? Another tier to grind only to find more broken content? And let's not mention how much is going to break due to the addition of open PvP.

SOE, you're really starting to make me want to cancel my account!

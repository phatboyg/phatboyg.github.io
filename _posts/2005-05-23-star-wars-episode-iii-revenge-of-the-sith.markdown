A few of us went to see the 12:01 am showing on Wednesday/Thursday. It was a good time, the film was great. I was a bit disappointed on the skin-ftw aspect as the queen was in maternity clothes the whole time instead of her famous white Britney Spears outfit. Oh well, the action made up for the shortcomings (including the horrendous Lucas dialog). It reminded me of the "I Love You, I Love You, I Love You" line by Don Lockwood from Singing in the Rain and the appropriate response from the audience "Did somebody get paid to write that dialog?"

Congrats to Lucas on a $158mm opener and a few knotches in the record book. Now he can set the record for opening day sales of his six-disc collectors edition set of all the movies.

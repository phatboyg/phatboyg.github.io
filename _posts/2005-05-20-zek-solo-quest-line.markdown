The very long quest line that including the Quincy ME in Zek, the tree guy, Lute and that other guy (it's like a chain of 20-30 quests) is finally done. It can be solo'd all the way through, although some of the final groups are 4-5 mobs of 40 single-downs that can hit pretty hard. There is also a boat trip at the end where there are three single down 40's as well.

It was a lot of fun, I recommend it for that alone. Also, there are a lot of overlapping quests that use the same mobs so be sure to find them all and work through them at the same time.

Onward to Feerrott!

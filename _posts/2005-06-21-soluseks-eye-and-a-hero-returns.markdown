I got on last night and who did I find online? Idapinhed! Talk about a serious vacation, it was nice to hear from "My Favorite Meatshield." Hopefully he'll be on more in the future.

In other news, I did the solo-targeted Forbidden Sepulcher instance in EF last night (too easy at 44) to complete the amulet quest. I also tried to finish up more of the headstone quests to get access to another instance in EF. 

While finishing them, I got invited to a Sol Eye group, so I jumped half a dozen zones and took the portal to the Sol Eye entrance (so that run around Lavastorm turned out to be valuable at last). Sol Eye is a freaking amazing looking zone, almost like something out of Unreal Tournament. It was awesome, I'm going to take some screenshots next time.

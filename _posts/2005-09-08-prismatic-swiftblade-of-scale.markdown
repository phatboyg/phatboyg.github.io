Well, we did Darathar last night and got the pieces of the prismatic egg. The fight went quickly I might add, with only a couple of deaths due to pet aggro. In fact, compared to some of the other encounters in the game (Arch Lich, etc.) this was actually a very easy fight.

I still need to visit Nagafan to get my weapon, but the raid portions of the quest are complete. Let's hear it for another round of prismatics for Mob Squad!

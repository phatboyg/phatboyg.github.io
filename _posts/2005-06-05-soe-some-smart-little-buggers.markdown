I was trying to figure out how to get some of my bankroll on my main over to my new cleric in Qeynos. Obviously the mail system is out, so I tried to be sneaky. I put a drink up for sale on my toon in Qeynos for 10g. I then logged in my main and went to the fence to buy it. Boy was I surprised when I realized that SOE had already thought of it and blocked purchases from alts on your account.

Bugger!

Once I hit 50, I put the brakes on everything XP related until they unlock 51 in September. However, since the FBSS is such a powerful melee item, I had to go ahead and finish this one up. Thanks to the help of some guild members (including one seriously overpowered Warlock that probably could have solo'd Oodan the Tranquil), I finished it up last night. So I'm now sitting at a base haste of 15%, a nice little bump. When my Lithe Disbelief procs (45% haste for 30 seconds), I should have a nice quick attack base for laying down some damage.

Oh, and my EverHarvest finally paid off, I got a Rhodium Cluster last night. That will be nice once the combat changes go live and I decide which skills that were previously worthless are worthy of an upgrade.

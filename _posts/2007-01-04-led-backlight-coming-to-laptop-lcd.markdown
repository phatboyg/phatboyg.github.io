Well, the rumor is that HP is developing a system of using LEDs to backlight a flat panel instead of the long used CCFL (cold-cathode flourescent light). The benefits should be obvious (solid stable color output, wide color gamut, basically, all that good stuff) based on what is happening in the RPTV market (see the Samsung post).

Rumor also says that Apple will use the technology in an upcoming flat panel device (MacBook Pro Core 2 Quad perhaps). If so, that would be a good sign if the technology turns out to be sweet.

Of course, this will probably just be a start, with regular LCD TV soon benefiting from the same advantages.

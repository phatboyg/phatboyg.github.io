Last night, the guild put in some work, finished off all the drakotas and went back to the Isle of Refuge for a good old fashioned Darathar beat down. At level 60, this encounter is almost a joke. I remember at 50, it was a serious adventure and hardly a perfect raid. But we smoked him down so far this time it wasn't funny. We even used one of our other tanks and let Zyxlin save his armor for the Court of Alafaz. :)

Congrats members who finally got their prismatics, just in time to finish the prismatic 2.0 quest shortly!

The guys at [Los Techies](http://lostechies.com/) have invited me to join their ranks and start posting on their blog. I've accepted the invitation and am looking forward to being part of their great community. I met several of the guys in Austin (one of which managed to snag a shot of [Dru Sellers](http://geekswithblogs.net/dsellers/Default.aspx) and me looking very sleepy) and they've got a good thing going over there.

I'll continue to post in both locations as I figure out how to best integrate the content between the sites. I switched to FeedBurner for my feed so hopefully I can aggregate the content somehow. That, and getting [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) to format the content nicely for Community Server (it seems that most Mac users don't post on Community Server blog hosts so demand hasn't been too high there). I think I've got the kinks worked out but I'm still massaging the process a bit.

So check me out here or [at my blog on Los Techies](http://lostechies.com/blogs/chris_patterson/Default.aspx), one way or another you should be able to find me!

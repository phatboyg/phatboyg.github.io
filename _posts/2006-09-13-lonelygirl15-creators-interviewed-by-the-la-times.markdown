In the wake of Bree's outing and the CAA lead we found, the producers behind the serial drama have [given an interview](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-me-lonelygirl13sep13,1,3672640.story?coll=la-headlines-entnews) to Richard Rushfield of the L.A. Times. In the article, they discuss how they met, how the group was formed, their intentions and production methods. They didn't name their actress, although we've found that out already.

A great day of LG15 news for sure, Daniel is still in the wind, funny how nobody has found him yet.

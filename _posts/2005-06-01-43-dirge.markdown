I reached level 43 last night and also completed the L&L; for lizards.

I had the Rough Ruby refined into an Adept 3 version of Bereavement, which I got at level 43, so I was able to test it out. What a nice spell. Fast attack, drains lots of power, heals for around 100 and refreshes quickly. A very nice replacement for the quick-attack line.

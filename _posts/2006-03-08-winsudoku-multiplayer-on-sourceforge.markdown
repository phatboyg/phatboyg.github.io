In my trek to find a multiplayer version of Sudoku for networks, I ran across this version on SourceForge.

[WinSudoku](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winsudoku/)

It includes the source, is public domain, and seems to work pretty well. I'm thinking of enhancing it a bit to offer some features I would like, but the basics are there and that is a good thing!

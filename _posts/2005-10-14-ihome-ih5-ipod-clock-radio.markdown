For my birthday, my wife got me a great gift:

It seems to work well, it woke me up this morning (I didn't say it got me out of bed, just up on time). Like many reviews said, the display is a tad bright in a dark room, but nothing intolerable unless you sit and stare at the clock while trying to go to sleep. In fact, it makes a nice light when trying to find your way to the bathroom in the middle of the night.

Control of the iPod seems solid. The play/pause/off functions work as advertised. I would have liked a next/previous track button without having to grab for the iPod, but I think that is offered with the remote (which I understand why it wasn't included, but come on, why didn't they just put it in the box to save shipping/distribution).

Sound is good, particularly for an alarm clock. The buzzer is shrill, and since it's different from my last alarm clock, I found it actually woke me up. I'm sure I'll get used to it like all the others and find I can ignore it even at the highest volume within a few weeks. :)

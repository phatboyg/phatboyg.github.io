Well, based on the buzz around the interwebs that the bug counts were too high for being so close to June, [Apple Insider is reporting](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/04/12/apple_delays_leopard_release_until_october.html) that Apple has delayed the launch of Leopard until October. They quoted sources indicating the quality was just not up to the standards expected by Apple's loyal customer base.

This gives Vista a nine month head start, but I'm not sure I give that much value. Everyone that I know personally who has bought a new computer since Microsoft forced OEMs to install Vista has **removed** Vista and installed Windows XP instead. Vista is like dating a cheerleader, it's fun for a while and it's easy to look at, but in the end the substance just isn't there.

So look for a fresh set of MacBook and MacBook Pro systems around that timeframe, hopefully based on Santa Rosa and LED backlit LCD panels!

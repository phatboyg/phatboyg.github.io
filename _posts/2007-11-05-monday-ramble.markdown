I've been lazy the last few days so a quick update this morning.

  * AppleTV  
We've been using this more (thanks to Handbrake, no help from Apple sadly) around the house for kids shows and movies. It's a shame Apple doesn't make it easier to leverage this product, it's so compact and subtle, but searching for anything video related is a complete pain in the butt. And forget music without a set of defined playlists. An upgrade from Apple to support uPnP would be nice instead of only iTunes, but that's probably not likely.
  * Guitar Hero 3  
I need to get some time to play this more. I certainly enjoyed the first couple of sets and the game itself is showing so much polish compared to previous versions. I really dig it.
  * iPhone  
I still love my iPhone -- it's a great device. Rumors are version 1.1.2 (minor upgrade to annoy the hackers) is due any day, along with an updated version of iTunes (7.5).
  * OSX Leopard  
This refresh of OSX is great and I continue to find more and more new things I like about it. There are a few minor annoyances, but I've figured out one of them at least. My intermittent network connection is due to the fact that my RJ45 plug isn't locking into my MacBook Pro and keeps slipping in and out, in and out, in and... Anyway, fixed.
  * Subaru WRX STI  
With the updates to the ECU, I love driving this car. And the cooler weather has really brought on some new grunt that just feels so good. That, and not having to run the air conditioner!
  * Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control with Castle Windsor  
I gave my talk at work last week and I think it went well. I've gotten some good constructive feedback and will publish a blog post of the content in the near future. I hope to tune the presentation and add it my roster of talks for upcoming user group meetings.

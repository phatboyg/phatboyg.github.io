Well. This one is out there. For sure.

[Fiat is introducing a fart-powered car. No shit!](http://www.autoblog.com/2006/09/17/paris-preview-methane-powered-fiats/)


_"In addition to the higher-output [Panda Sport](http://www.autoblog.com/2006/09/11/paris-preview-first-photo-of-fiat-panda-sport/), Fiat will be showing two new methane-powered vehicles at the Paris show at the end of the month. Over the past year, across Europe, Fiat has sold 24,000 methane-powered cars; the major advantage being reduced CO2 emissions." _

I setup a teamspeak server for the guild and friends yesterday and it seemed to work fine last night. Teamspeak is so much easier than typing for those that use it, but it can make groups quiet for that one person who doesn't have it. So get it!

It's a free download from: [TeamSpeak Site](http://www.goteamspeak.com/)

You can view the details of ther server: [TeamSpeak Server Details](http://www.phatboyg.com/ts2/listing.php?detail=67.19.40.101&detailport=8988)

It is a private server so it won't accept connections without a password. I posted the information on the private guild forums for the guild channel, but you likely only know the server password if you've been in a group with me and we used it.

The server is at a commercial hosting facility and is up 24/7 with full high-rate codec support.

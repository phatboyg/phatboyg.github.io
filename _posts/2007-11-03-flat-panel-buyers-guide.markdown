I just checked out this [Buyer's Guide](http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/other/display/lcd-guide-f2007.html) on flat panels and learned a lot about the various technologies used and why my 22" at work seems weak compared to my 20" Dell at home.Check it out and see why certain displays are so expensive!FYI: I found about this guide from [Jeff Atwood's](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000991.html) blog.

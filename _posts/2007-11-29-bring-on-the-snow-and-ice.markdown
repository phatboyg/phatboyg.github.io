After Tulsa was hit three times with major ice storms last year, I decided to be prepared this year!

I picked up a set of Blizzak REVO 1 snow and ice tires for the Subaru. The way I look at it, if I get to have fun with them only once this winter they will be worth it. But summer tires are not recommended for use under 45 degrees and it gets pretty cold here in the winter even when the roads are dry. And since our location in the jet stream usually gives us freezing rain and ice instead of snow, I wanted to be prepared.

I'm sure I'll get some chuckles when I mount them up, but they were easily $40 a tire less than all seasons -- and all seasons just didn't make sense on my STI.

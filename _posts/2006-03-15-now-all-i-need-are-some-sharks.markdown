Okay, so gadgets are pretty slick, particularly when they are useless (you know, things like the Pocket PC). I found site after looking for something else and thought they had some pretty slick items. If you are into lasers (we're not talking about pointers anymore, these things can burn rubber), this site has what looks to be some pretty slick devices. A range over fifty miles for a green laser? That's just crazy. I can't imagine how dangerous one of these things would be to use for nothing more than a novelty. I'm sure it would burn a hole right through our projection screen at work!

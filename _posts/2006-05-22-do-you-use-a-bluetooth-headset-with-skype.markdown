I'm thinking about getting a wireless (Bluetooth) headset for use with Skype. Since they now have free domestic calling and I picked up a SkypeIn number, I thought about giving a wireless headset a shot. Plus, I think it would be perfect for my wife in and around the kitchen. So, if you've found something that works well and has good range, high sound quality and decent battery life.

Anyone?

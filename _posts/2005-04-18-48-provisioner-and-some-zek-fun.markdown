I reached 48th level in provisioner this past weekend. All this just cranking down inventory raws into something useful.

Also, last night grouped up with Kikkomon and several others from Dark Horizon and managed to just walk all over Zek and an endless stream of Epic x2 mobs. Had several master chest drops, including an opal, oak, half a dozen Adept I spells and some armor/weapons to boot. I got squat, but Operation Green Hood is a few steps closer to done. Most of all, it was a total blast running mayhem and watching a necromancer pull a dozen mobs. At one point, I'm pretty sure we were fighting two epic groups (like 8 mobs) and it could have been three as Kikkomon was pulling the two groups while were were finishing off a third. Nuts I tell you!

Let's face it, installing Windows is a real pain in the ass. Drivers never load properly, things get whacked out of order, nothing ever goes as easy as it would seem.

I recently switched my old Athlon XP mainboard (Soyo junker) for a new nForce 430 with built-in nVidia 6150 graphics (The Asus A8N-VM CSM) and nVidia SATA RAID. I put in 1GB of RAM and a Athlon 64 3200 to complete the package. The board is slick, in addition to the built-in video, it also has 8 USB 2.0 ports, 2 1394 ports, gigabit ethernet, and a host of drive connections.

At the same time, I put four (4) Seagate 250GB SATA drives in a RAID5 array. Why? Because I'm seriously tired of drives failing (read: Maxtor crap) and I have too much data that is worth keeping alive. This is where things got interesting.

Booting Windows XP from a raid system is a chore, particularly when the drivers are unsigned and not part of the base Windows installation. This is where [nLite](http://www.nliteos.com/) comes into the picture.

nLite lets you customize your Windows installation, add drivers, remove crap you don't want, etc. In the end, I created a single CD with a full installation of Windows Media Center Edition 2005 and the required nVidia RAID drivers. I now have a system that boots from a 200GB partition with a 500GB data partition, all RAID5 protected.

With an external 300GB Seagate for backups, I think I'm all set for data security. Now I just need to find a reliable off-site, on-line data backup facility to ensure complete data redundancy and life will be worry-free as far as data is concerned.

I decided to finish out some items in my bank this weekend and hit 50 provisioner Sunday morning. No new book, no excitement, just a new level and some higher skills. I still have over 100 stacks of T5 items in the bank to turn into useful goods, I just need to make them as I need them at this point.

I'll likely scale back my raws for food program a bit as I need to spend more time working on my quests and adventure level at this point.

Also, I completed like another 30+ quests this past weekend by finishing up the solo line of quests in Zek. I previously did the entire solo line in EL which was fun and had some great rewards.

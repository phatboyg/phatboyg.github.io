A few things of note I've seen so far announced at CES:

[Sandisk Sensa View](http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/08/sandisk-sansa-view/)
In leiu of a full-screen video iPod, this could certainly fit the bill for those with video on the brain.

Is that it? Well, for now. Everything else is pretty much expected. Bigger LCDs, bigger plasmas, HD camcorders, tons of media players, new phones for those who haven't discovered the BlackBerry.

I'm anxious for MacWorld tomorrow, the CES for those of us that really don't care about the rest.

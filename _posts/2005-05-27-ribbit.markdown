They unleashed the frogs yesterday, so I decided to go ahead and do the quest to enable the force-sensitive, er, frog slot on my character. Not that I want to create one of these nasty turds, just because it's a nice bump in the completed quest count and who knows what else it unlocks.

Then I went and created a new priest of Queynos and found at least a dozen of the little lizards bouncing around the island. 

Anybody know of a way to /ignore a player so they don't show up at all???

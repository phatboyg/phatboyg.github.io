I went with the guild on a Darathar raid last night, the second time we've returned to the Isle of Refuge to take care of this ancient dragon. The fight went very well, seemingly less difficult than some of the other epic mobs we've tackled (or in a couple of cases, attempted is probably a better word).

Congrats to another group of guildmates who got their prismatic weapons for completing the quest series. I'm in the next round, starting with Fire And Ice (the rez vox part) and ending up with Deception.

It looks like the local Tulsa .NET Users Groups ([TulsaDevelopers.NET](http://www.tulsadevelopers.net/)) is planning to have a spring code camp on May 10th, 2008. It's going to be at the Tulsa Community College North Campus. I'm hoping that I'll be able to do a presentation on message-driven architecture at the event along with fellow [MassTransit](http://code.google.com/p/masstransit/) author [Dru Sellers](http://www.drusellers.com/). We plan on refining some of the MassTransit architecture after talking with [Udi Dahan](http://udidahan.weblogs.us/) and [Ayende Rahien](http://www.ayende.com/) at the upcoming [Seattle ALT.NET conference](http://altdotnet.org/events/seattle).

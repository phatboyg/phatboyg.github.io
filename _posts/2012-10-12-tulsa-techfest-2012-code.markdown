Here is the code from my talk at Tulsa TechFest on SignalR. Thanks to those of you who came to the talk, I hope you learned enough about SignalR to determine if it's the right technology for you. Be sure you have enabled NuGet to restore packages on build so the required references all get downloaded and installed from the NuGet site.

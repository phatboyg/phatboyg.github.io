I dinged level 39 last night. Nice to see the new guild features working where you see when your guildmates gain levels (both adventurer and artisan). I spent most of this level doing quests in EL and finishing up quests in Zek as well. I think the J-boots alone game me 27% xp in 38.

I also finished the entire line of solo quests in EL that are started by the little circus folks, you know, the ones that have small hands and smell like cabbage? Anyway, I got a recipe for a 6-hour food that adds power! Sweet! Not too tough to make, although it uses like 2 honey and 1 wild apple. I don't know if it's superior or high yet, but let's hope for superior!

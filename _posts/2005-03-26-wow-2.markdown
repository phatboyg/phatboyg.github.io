Got together with Debuke, Vencane, LuthorLuxor? and Ambroze last night on WoW. It's the crew at work mostly, but a few that used to work with us. On Dalaran server, Alliance faction. Ambroze, being a night elf, has a long journey ahead, but will arrive with us in due course. The dorfs were close and just took the tram system to get to Elywynn Forest (sp).

Also managed to make 42nd provisioner last night, only two more to go so I can make the first level of drinks!

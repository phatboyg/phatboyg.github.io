Last week, I gave a talk at the Northwest Arkansas .NET user group on SignalR. Based on the response (as I've seen at nearly every event I've spoken about SignalR), there is a lot of interest in this library for building rich HTML applications with .NET backend services.




The demo code from the talk, which includes an action item list, along with an external service that posts events to browser clients via MassTransit, is available for download below.

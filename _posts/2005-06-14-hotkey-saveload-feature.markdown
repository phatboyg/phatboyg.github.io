I found this on the forums, but wanted to make sure I didn't lose it so I'm reposting it here. Credit to the original poster if I could remember who it was. This is excellent for mentoring as it lets you save multiple hot bar sets.

To save your current hotkeys:
`/savehotkeys c:\eq2\normal.dat`

To load a previously saved set of hotkeys:
`/loadhotkeys c:\eq2\filename.dat`

There are reportedly some bugs with macros and their selected icon, so be wary if you use those.

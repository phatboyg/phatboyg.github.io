We raided Gates last night and got some pretty sweet items. We made it to the fourth court, but people started getting bored and some encounters got triggered that pretty much made it so we couldn't play through without aggroing a ton of encounters at once. So we called the raid at that point. We had little problem with any of the encounters, but didn't have any indium links on us so the jewelry table sat unused (for this run anyway).

Some folks got some nice items, I got a Coif of Silent Somethingorother that is pretty sweet.

Oh, and a couple more masters, Lanet's and Tarven's. I seriously need to get masters or adept 3's for my debuffs as some of the encounters in the raid zones are highly resistant to them.

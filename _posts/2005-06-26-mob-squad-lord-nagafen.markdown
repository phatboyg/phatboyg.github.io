Last night, I joined a new guild called Mob Squad. I've been playing with this guild for a few days and they are a great bunch of folks focused on having fun and helping others. I've had nothing but good times with them and am glad they accepted me as a member. At this point, I've got applicant status, but I hope to prove to them that I'm a solid player and fit into their guild.

Last night, we advanced To Speak as a Dragon, and now it's off to get all the shards for the quest. Redd and I did a bunch of them last night, but there are plenty left.

Speaking of dragons:

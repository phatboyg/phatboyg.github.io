Engadget is reporting that Morgan Stanley indicates an iPhone on the horizon. While I'm not completely sold on it since details are paper thin (even the photo is fake), it would absolutely destroy the Razr and other options since anything with the iPod name on it sells.

I'm obviously somewhat excited about the possibility, but given the vapor-nature of the phone, I will hold my breath for now.

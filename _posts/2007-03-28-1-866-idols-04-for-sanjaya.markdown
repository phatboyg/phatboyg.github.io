That's the number for Sanjaya this week, use it!

Update: Looks like Ryan let a little thing slip during the show. It seems that the show has to pay royalties to the original artists for all the songs used on the show. He said this as Blake was about to bust into a No Doubt song, "Don't sing it or we'll have to pay for it." He followed with, "I'm sure I'm going to hear about that from Fox tomorrow."

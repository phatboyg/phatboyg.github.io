I got [tagged](http://www.codesqueeze.com/what-music-do-you-code-to/) by Max Pool of [{codesqueeze}](http://www.codesqueeze.com/) regarding my choice of tunes while coding.

For me, it's all about down tempo beats and no lyrics. And it started on [DI.fm](http://www.di.fm/) in the [Chillout Channel](http://www.di.fm/chillout/).

I was listening to a mix that just really got the juices flowing called Ott Times. It was mixed by [Morlack](http://www.psyshop.com/shop/World/). The song lead me on a quest to find the artists in the mix, which included:



	
  * Shpongle

	
  * Ott

	
  * Younger Brother

	
  * Entheogenic

	
  * Shulman

	
  * Hallucinogen


Since then, I've managed to acquire almost every physical CD of each of these artists. I've put together a few of my favorite playlists that I enjoy while coding, chilling, or doing whatever. So that's my flavor, one that's worked for a while. I've since added some new artists to the roster, including Phutureprimitive and a few others. It's amazing what you can find just lying in bed searching through the iTunes music store on your iPhone.

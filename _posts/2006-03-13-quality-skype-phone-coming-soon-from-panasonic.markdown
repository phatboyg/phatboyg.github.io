Panasonic is releasing the KX-TG9000 cordless phone with built-in Skype support. This is a full-featured phone actually running Skype with no PC required. More and more devices like this are showing up and it is only a matter of time before Skype becomes much more commonly used by regular people. Honestly, if you make international calls, you are insane NOT to use it because it is so cheap and you can call regular land lines around the world. Calling a hotel to check reservations in Hong Kong was clear as a bell -- a must when you only partially understand the language.

I can't wait personally, I look forward to more and more Skype-enabled products.

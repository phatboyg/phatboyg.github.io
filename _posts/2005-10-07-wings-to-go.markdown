Well, I just realized that I have never posted about [Wings To Go](http://www.wingstogo.com/). I never liked chicken wings until I went here with some coworkers. Now I'm hooked. The variety of flavors, the freshness of the chicken, the demonic fries that you just can't avoid, it's a complete package and the real deal. I would not imagine eating wings anywhere else if I can help it.

If you have one in your town, check it out. If you don't, next time you're on a trip give a location a shot. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

My favorite? Bar-B-cide (a mixture of barbeque and suicide)

Give them a try!

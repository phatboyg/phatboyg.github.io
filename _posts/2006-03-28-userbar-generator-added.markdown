My signature generator for EQ2 gets a lot of traffic. Now it seems that "Userbars" are becoming popular for their small size (350x19) and subtle appearance. To keep in step, I've added an initial user bar generator. You can use the default background image (of which I may add to the selection, and will certainly accept any PNG submissions as well to add) or reference a background image from another site (see instructions). It will then plug your character name, level, tradeskill level (optional) and server name.

To generate your own Userbar, use the following image links:

http://phatboyg.com/eq2sig/ubar.php?playerId=109225106
![](http://phatboyg.com/eq2sig/ubar.php?playerId=109225106)

Optional parameters:

&template;=url
Specify the full URL of an image to use as the background (350x19).

_**Be sure to change playerId= to point to the ID from the URL on the EQ2Players site.**_

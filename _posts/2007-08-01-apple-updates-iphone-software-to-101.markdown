Late last night, Apple released an iPhone software update. The update is described as a bug fix update only -- no new features. It's likely the fix was released to address the known vulnerabilities in the Safari browser that were set to be make public on August 2nd.

I haven't noticed any differences, but hopefully we'll fewer crashes in Safari.

The update came almost one month after the initial release. The iPhone continues to be a joy to use and if you have the means I highly recommend picking on up. It's so choice.

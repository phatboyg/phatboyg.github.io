Well, it's still working after the new changes, but the level history page is broken on the EQ2Players site, so until they fix it the Last Leveled section of the signature will be blank. Once they fixed the permissions, it should just start showing up again. I also fixed the code to look at the new page name for achievements (now called Rankings). I cleared the cache, so the updated signatures should start showing up soon.

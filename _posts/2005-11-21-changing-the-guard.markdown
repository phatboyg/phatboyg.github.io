Last night, after some of the usual raids to get some fabulous wood, we went to Maj'Dul. Our goal was to kill the tower captains to change the guard over to all blades. We located the offending towers and proceeded to clean them smooth out.

Once all the towers are changed, a 57x4 epic spawns. We handily dispatched with that beast and walked away with a nice fabled mage ring for one of our casters. The epic was surprisingly easy given the work needed to spawn it. I'm sure we'll do this on a regular basis now that we've done it once.

We followed that run up with an instance or two, neither of which dropped anything memorable. 

I've got a couple of other things to post on, but I'll make them separate as they may get bumped as things progress -- not sure how I'm going to handle it yet.

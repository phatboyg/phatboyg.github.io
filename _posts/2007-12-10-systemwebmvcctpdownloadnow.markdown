It seems the [MVC (model-view-controller) framework being added to ASP.NET has been released](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A9C6BC06-B894-4B11-8300-35BD2F8FC908&displaylang=en) as a CTP.

There are a ton of posts about how to use the MVC, including [a great series on Scott Gu's Blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/13/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-1.aspx).

There, now I'm one of the thousands who probably blogged this today.

Saw this from CES, looks like a winner. Available in March for under $1000, it includes navigation, DVD video playback, solid high-speed iPod integration, support for AAC, and numerous other features. Look for this one to get some serious penetration.

There is also a community for the AVIC line of receivers at [AVIC411.COM](http://www.avic411.com/).

UPDATE: Pioneer has the [full details](http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/pna/v3/pg/product/details/0,,2076_310069681_369264980_tab=B,00.html?compName=PNA_V3_ProductDetailsComponent) on the D3 posted online. Looks like iTunes AAC support is included now as well. I wonder if that includes Apple Lossless Codec support for playing ALC tunes from your iPod via the D3.

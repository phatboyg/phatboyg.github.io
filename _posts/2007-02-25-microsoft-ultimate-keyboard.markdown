You tell me, is it? [Microsoft Ultimate Keyboard ](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/ultimatekeyboard/default.mspx)Bluetooth, rechargeable, backlit, tons of Vista keystroke goodies, what else could you want? Looks like a winner to me, but I'd have to try it first. My current G15/G5 combo are awesome for games, but since I never play them anymore it makes me wonder what else could benefit my typing action. I'm more thinking home theater/media center at this point. But who knows.

SanDisk has released a [32GB SSD](http://www.sandisk.com/Oem/Default.aspx?CatID=1478) for the consumer market. Based on the performance and power numbers, this monster is going to be sweet. Extreme speed and half the power of a hard disk make this technology a solid winner in the mobile marketplace. They say it is capable of 100 times the IO operations of a regular disk drive. I find that hard to believe, but who am I to doubt product marketing info?

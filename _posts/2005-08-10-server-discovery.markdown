I got my first meaningful server discovery last night (the previous two were failed crafting attempts, how fun). We completed Anvilpaw's Grotto last night and I picked up a new pair of shoes, [Forlorn Boots of Turmoil](http://eq2players.station.sony.com/en/item.vm?itemId=73400). Pretty decent AC, nice STA/STR bonuses and some good saves (including vs slashing).

We also did Meeting of the Minds (which we also did the night before, the raid I always forget) and Mak/Shak in Antonica (all wood).

FYI, the zone continues to be frustrating with all the gates and such, but I think we're figuring it out so that we don't waste a ton of time getting through the puzzles any longer.

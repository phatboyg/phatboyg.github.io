What a late night last night. I hooked up with some guildies and finished the SBD quest and advanced the FBSS a few steps. The SBD was not too bad, a great weapon at my level, I'm using it instead of the Yak when solo and instead of the PGT when grouped.

I also managed to get some quests done in EF, although I'm still unsure about the access quests and zones in here as I haven't been all over the place yet. Regardless it was a fun time and I hope to find out more about this zone soon enough.

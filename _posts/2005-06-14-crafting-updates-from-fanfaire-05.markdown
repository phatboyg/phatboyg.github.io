There is a great update from a fanfaire attendee regarding tradeskill changes that are coming in future releases. Personally, once I saw the crafting stations on EverFrost, I ran home to fill my bags with raws and fuel to come out and enjoy a chilly day of cooking at the stove! Some good news in here, hopefully it happens sooner rather than later.

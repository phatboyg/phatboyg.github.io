I'm happy to announce that I have been awarded the 2012 Microsoft® MVP award for my technical contributions to the Visual C# community over the past year. This is the fourth consecutive year that I have received the award, and I greatly appreciate the recognition. I would also like to thank everyone who has supported me over the past year, allowing me the time to prepare interesting content, travel to amazing conferences (including my first trip to Sweden last year), and deliver engaging presentations to the software development community.

As I look back at the past three years, the most rewarding benefit of being an MVP awardee is communication with the product teams at Microsoft. Being able to discuss product goals, features, and roadmaps with the actual development teams is extremely valuable. When I look at how Microsoft has evolved over the past couple of years alone, I see a company that is embracing open source (look at the full ASP.NET web stack) and retooling their development products to facility greater sharing of open source libraries (NuGet, for example). I look forward to even more interaction with the teams over the next year as the Windows platform adapts to the changing modalities in personal computing.

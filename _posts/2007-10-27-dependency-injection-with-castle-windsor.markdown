I'm writing a presentation on dependency injection with Castle Windsor to give at work this coming week. I'm going to present it at a lunch and learn for the software developers in our department. It should be interesting, I'm curious to see how it goes. If all goes well, it will be the first of a series that I'm going to put together.

Once I have the content and have run through it, I'll post the samples and text here for everyone to enjoy. While it is introductory in terms of DI/IoC, it's a fairly advanced topic compared to general programming topics. Should be fun!

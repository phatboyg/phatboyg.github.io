I panned this when I first saw it, but it's starting to look like a pretty slick device. Mind you, I despise any previous attempt by Sony to make a computer. They're just overpriced, under-supported and risky at best. But they do have that Sony Style.

Okay, this thing is 150.2×32.2×95mm -- That's like 6" by 3.75" by 1.2" -- That thing is freaking small! And it weighs 540g -- that's what? A pound? That's madd!

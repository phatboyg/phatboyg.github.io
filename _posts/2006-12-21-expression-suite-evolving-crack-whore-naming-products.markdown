The [Microsoft Expression](http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/default.mspx) suite of tools seems to be coming along. Of course, I can't make heads or tails of the names since some crack whore seems to have taken over the marketing department and renamed all the products. Blend? That's something you do to a daquiri, not a user interface (well, unless it's Corel Draw from the 80's, that blend feature was cool).

Nonetheless, these tools are going to get your designers into your Visual Studio 2005 workspace directly tweaking the next-generation XAML for your web/application designs with .NET 3.0 so you better figure out how to speak pretty and functional at the same time.

Just another tool in the VS2005 workspace belt. It's pretty much a known fact in the developer world that anything this is not user-space is VS2005 from here on out. Everything that builds/manages the OS/network is being worked into the VS2005 framework since it is so friendly and easy to use (did I say that?).

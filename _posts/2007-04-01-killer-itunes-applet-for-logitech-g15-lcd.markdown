While looking for some LCD applets to make my G15 more useful since I no longer play EQ2, I came across an awesome applet that lets you control iTunes. The program works great and was easy to install.

You can start iTunes completely from the LCD, navigate your library, start, stop, search (using an iPod style UI on the LCD), and adjust your settings without exiting the application you are in (which is likely intended to be a game or something).

You can check it out on the [author's website](http://thunderstruck.awardspace.com/do.cgi?nav=itunes).

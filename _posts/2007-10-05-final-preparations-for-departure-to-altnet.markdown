I'm getting the last few things together before I take off for Austin in the morning to attend the ALT.NET conference. I tested out the new MacBook Pro with a projector in our conference room today to make sure that I knew how to get it working just in case (not like there won't be plenty of "Maclovin" this weekend). I could torture you all with a remake of a classic poem:



Twas the night before ALT.NET, when all through the house.  

Not a battery was depleted, not even the Bluetooth mouse.  

The carry on was packed, with clean socks and underwear.  

With hope that Martin Fowler soon would be there.



But that would be too mean. If you are attending the event, see you there! If not, stay tuned for updates throughout the weekend. I'll try to keep my Flickr photo stream updated as things unfold.

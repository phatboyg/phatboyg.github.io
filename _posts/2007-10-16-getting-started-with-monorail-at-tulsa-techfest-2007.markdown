This weekend I will be giving a presentation on [MonoRail](http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html) at the second annual [Tulsa TechFest](http://www.tulsatechfest.com/). The event is packed with technical information for anyone in IT including a variety of tracks on security, networking, software development and management.

Last year I talked about using Microsoft's new ASP.NET AJAX (previously Atlas) tools for building browser-based applications, as well as how to leverage the tools with asynchronous web services. This year I've chosen to present a getting started level introduction to MonoRail. With the Microsoft announcement of an MVC framework (System.Web.Mvc), it's no doubt that there will be a lot of interest in what MVC is and how it differs from regular WebForms development.

The excerpt for my talk reads:



MonoRail is a different way to build ASP.NET applications that enforces the separation of concerns. Built using the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern, MonoRail uses controllers to handle application flow, models to represent data, and views for presentation. The end result is a web application that is maintainable and testable. This session demonstrates how to get started using MonoRail quickly and easily.



If you are anywhere near Tulsa, I highly recommend attending the free event this weekend. There will be a ton of technical content, free lunch, giveaways, and a whole lot of nerds. If you are shopping for a job, I can absolutely guarantee that there will be several consulting firms looking for developers to fill out their staff.

With all the talk about cars lately, I just wanted to mention that I run a motorsports oriented web site for the Oklahoma and Arkansas called [Green Country Motorsports](http://www.greencountrymotorsports.com/). The site is a simple portal with a forum and features many members who are active in area Autocross, Rally, Open Track (Hallett) and some drag racing events.

The site has been around for more than four years and we've managed to keep a pretty solid base of regulars and the conversations are focused and mature. If you are into motorsports in the area (Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Bartlesville, Fayetteville, Stillwater), you might check it out. We keep an updated calendar of upcoming area events as well, and the Northeastern Oklahoma SCCA Solo II planning committee regularly mention events and results on the site.

So stop by and check it out!

I got into a group with [Mob Squad](http://mobsquad.eq2guilds.org/index.vm?) last night and obtained the **To Speak as a Dragon** quest starter. This is the first of a series of quests to meet Darathar. It was a fun, albeit brief, adventure and hopefully I'll see more of this crew in the near future.

I also advanced The Lost Legend of Lavastorm and completed the Words of Pure Magic quest to speak the language needed for the quest.

I took the night off to spend some time with the family last night and to catch up on some sleep. But I woke up this morning and hit RV for some harvesting and to finish up some quests. Funny how now that I don't need the access quests I'm high enough level to finish them solo -- oh well.

Here's to a successful quest to get another ebon cluster, I hope I win!

Hopefully we'll be back in action tonight to get the Fire and Ice quest advanced. It seems like overall we've had some light turnout Thu/Fri so we'll see what happens this weekend.

Logged in today during nap time and with the help of Valc and Celcius, I managed to collect the remaining runes and finish the quest To Speak as a Dragon. Now I need to head down and talk to Nagafen again to start the Fire and Ice quest. I'm getting close to 47, only 20% left. Hopefully a couple of raids tonight should garner enough XP to make it happen. If not, I'll have to go kill mindless drones of mobs until I ding before I hit the sack!

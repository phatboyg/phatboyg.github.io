Well, my birthday isn't until this weekend, but I've got a hell of a busy one with TechFest this weekend so my wife gave me my present early! A wireless Guitar Hero II controller!

I'm charging the batteries up now so we'll have some review information added later tonight!

Well fuck that. The controller doesn't work with the Guitar Hero II demo and it is confirmed that it will not work with the final game. No reason to even open the package, it's going back to the store.

I guess I need to pre-order the official Red Octane wireless controller that is coming out with GH2 on Nov 7th.

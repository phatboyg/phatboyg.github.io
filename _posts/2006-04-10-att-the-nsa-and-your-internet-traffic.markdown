Wow, this really surprised me since the general public seems to think projects like Carnivore were dead in the water. The NSA is getting a raw feed of all Internet traffic that goes through AT&T;'s network. That sure seems like some serious data to process for possible "keyword" and "traffic pattern" flags that could draw the attention of the NSA. In fact, I'm sure this post will end up in there hands to some curious eyes (for no real reason what-so-ever, I have no ill plans for the government).

With a setup like this, AT&T; clearly can't be the only company in bed with the NSA. I would estimate all major providers are forwarding traffic for analysis in these secret rooms...

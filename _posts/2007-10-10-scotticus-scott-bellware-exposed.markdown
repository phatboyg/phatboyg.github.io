The hit count is rising, so what's another link to this great picture of [Scott Bellware](http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/default.aspx)!

Scott was responsible for organizing the ALT.NET conference in Austin this past weekend. His sometimes cavalier attitude was exposed by this picture posted on the wall on the final day. A great big thanks to Scott (and his posse, they know who they are) for putting on this event.

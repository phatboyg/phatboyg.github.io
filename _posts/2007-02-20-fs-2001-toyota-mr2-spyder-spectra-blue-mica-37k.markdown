**2001 Toyota MR-2 Spyder, Spectra Blue Mica, 5-speed Manual, 37,000 Miles
Original Adult Owner, Non-Smoker, Always Garaged (both at Work and Home)**

This vehicle has been a wonderful performer since I bought it new in April of 2001. The car has always been well maintained and driven an average of 6,000 miles a year (to and from work, mostly highway, 13 miles each way). The exterior paint is excellent (polished with Zaino products). The interior is very good, with minor wear on the leather at driver entry. The passenger seat is hardly used at all. The interior is clean and simple, just like it came from the factory.

Like most, I hate to sell it, but we're up to two kids now and the recent bad weather has left me in need of something more family-friendly. :(



	
  * Paint and body are excellent with no damage, only a few minor rock chips.

	
  * Nearly new Bridgestone Potenza SO3 Pole Positions with 3,000 miles on stock 15" wheels.

	
  * Upgraded audio system (complete stock appearance)

	
  * New motor (replaced at 36,800 miles by Toyota, Includes 1-year unlimited mile warranty from January, 2007)

	
  * New catalytic converter (replaced by Toyota under warranty)

	
  * Factory leather seats

	
  * JDM nose badge and wheel caps

	
  * Stainless steel brake lines (original lines included as well)

	
  * All original documentation and window sticker

I played a bit over the past weekend and managed to make a trip down to Solusek's Eye to turn in my relic chain boots. I haven't posted any of my recent loot, so I figured a few pictures were due. The earring I got over a month ago in a group in Den, but couldn't wear it until 70. The rest has been acquired over the past week. Thanks to Nogal for the drop (yeah, I realize they're lore and both your tunes had them already!) and Boehm for the help navigating the new and improved Sol Eye (mucho grats to the person who mapped that zone into eq2map, yikes).

Well, with VMware Fusion up and running, I setup a Windows 2003 Server system with Visual Studio 2005, all the tools, SQL Server 2005, the works. Then I threw the switch on Unity mode and I'm so freaking stoked right now I can't handle it. I'm going to backup the VM disk image onto an external drive so once the OS does the usual MS gig I can just restore the old disk and have a clean fresh system once again. Of course, I can just set a Snapshot in VMware as well, which I might try to see how well it works. Oh yeah, glossies:

Last night was pretty much a raid night only. They guild waxed the Angler like he was on training wheels (so much for buffed). However, the Lich appears to have been seriously buffed and we weren't so lucky there. We learned a few things though and will be trying him again soon.

Oh, and the Angler dropped metal -- bonus!

Then the entire guild did a multi-city raid on the broker and managed to buy pretty much every cold. poison and heat resist item available. What a night for junk-drop merchants!

As I stand now, 4300 unbuffed cold, 3200 poison (I don't remember heat). I was over 6K poison during raids, probably be around 6500 now.

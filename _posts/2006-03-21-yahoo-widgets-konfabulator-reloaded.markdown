I was wondering what happened to Konfabulator, the desktop widget utility that I used off-and-on for various purposes. Well, I ran across a link on the Yahoo site that shows the widgets are now part of a yahoo offering. I thought they looked familiar.

I wonder if they force you to install the Yahoo Toolbar in order to use them now? :)

We went into Gates again last night. It didn't take nearly as long as last time, and would have gone more quickly had it not been for a couple of mistakes.

As a bonus, we walked out of there with some pretty sweet loot, including Sniper Shot (Master I) for Kossos. I think before the night was over, Kossos landed a shot for over 10K with the new upgrade. Insane!

Looks like Microsoft has released [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx), an advanced scripting language for Windows machines.

> _Microsoft Windows PowerShell command line shell and scripting language helps IT Professionals achieve greater productivity. Using a new admin-focused scripting language, more than 130 standard command line tools, and consistent syntax and utilities, Windows PowerShell allows IT Professionals to more easily control system administration and accelerate automation. Windows PowerShell is easy to adopt, learn, and use, because it works with your existing IT infrastructure and existing script investments, and because it runs on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server “Longhorn”. Exchange Server 2007, System Center Operations Manager 2007, System Center Data Protection Manager V2, and System Center Virtual Machine Manager leverage Windows PowerShell to improve efficiency and productivity._

Fancy marketing name aside, this was previewed at the PDC as "Monad" and is built on the .NET framework (2.0). Seems like it could be pretty cool based on the early demos I saw of the product.

It seems that in digging through IMDB, I found an entry for a remake of the original 1979 movie _The Warriors_.

[The Warriors (2006)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423512/)

Seems like MTV is going to remake the movie in Los Angeles, but with different gangs and a more modern style (think bloods/crips?). I'm not sure how true to the original it will be, but you can bet I'm going to pick it up on DVD when it is released. As for seeing it in the theater, I doubt it. A quick jump over to [The Warriors Movie Site ](http://www.warriorsmovie.co.uk/newmovie/)confirmed the story.

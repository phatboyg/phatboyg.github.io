We took down a few raids last night, by the time I got on Icebound and Meeting of the Minds were done. I got in on Echoes of Time and the Deserted Mine. Yes, we once again took down that wurm and once again had massive repair bills post-raid due to the decomposition of equipment. It was funny, this time the coercer told us we kicked ass instead of merely getting by, so we smoked the waves this time!

I think we're going to start working on Fire and Ice and Deception soon, so that's good news for those of us who have yet to get our prismatic weapons!

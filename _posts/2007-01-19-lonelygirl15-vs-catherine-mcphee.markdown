For all of you who had McPheever last year when Kat was on American Idol, meet those of us that were mystified by the "Who is LonelyGirl15 phenomenom last August/September."

Katharine, a fan of the Internet mini-series LonelyGirl15, appears on the new episode "Truth or Dare" today. Now, if you aren't up-to-date, there are a lot of clips to watch but this one pretty much stands on its own without any background.

You can watch the new video on the official [LonelyGirl15 web site](http://www.lonelygirl15.com/) or on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/lonelygirl15) (where LG15 got started).

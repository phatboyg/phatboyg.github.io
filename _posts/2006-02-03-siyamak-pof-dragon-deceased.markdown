Last night, Mob Squad rolled out to Pillar of Flames to pay a visit to Siyamak. Siyamak is one of two contested dragons that appear in the zone. This mob is a 65x4 and has a ton of special effects, including Dark Breath, Tail, massive hits, AOE's, crazy stuff. I think Sony put the kitchen sink in this bugger cause it threw everything at us.

_Siyamak Autopsy In Progress_


As you can see on the [Mob Squad](http://www.mobsquad-guild.com/) home page, we put the poor soul out of it's misery before the night was over. A master chest full of T6 goodness was the prize.

Yesterday was also LU19, which included a few new features and a ton of spell line changes. When I logged in, I had over twenty new spells and had to arrange my spell book all over again. A few hotbar tweaks were needed as well. Overall, not a huge impact for the level 60 player, but I can't imagine the grief for those between 7-20 due to the changes. Maybe I should login my cleric (or, shall we say Templar now?) and see what's up. I sure hope those Adept I spells I have in my inventory are not worthless now -- but I bet they are.

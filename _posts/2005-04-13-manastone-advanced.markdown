Camped the Weavemaster in RoV last night and got the items to advance the manastone heritage. Too bad the greedy folks on Kithicor are charging 60g for the stupid tooth. I need to raise my trapping anyway so I'm going to try and get one myself first. I've gotten other glimmering items, so hopefully it won't be too difficult.

I'm still working on my provisions guide, hopefully I can finish it up by the end of the week.

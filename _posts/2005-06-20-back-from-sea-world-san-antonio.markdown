Had a nice weekend trip to San Antonio with the family (which explains my absence for the past few days). I hope to be back online tonight -- probably trying to once again finish that Splitpaw instance unless I manage to pickup a good group.

If in Sea World San Antonio, be sure to ride the Shark Attack, it's a blast!

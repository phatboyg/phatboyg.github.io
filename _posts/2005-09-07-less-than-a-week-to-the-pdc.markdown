With less than a week before the start of PDC05, things are shaping up. I'm still waiting to see how they distribute the birds of a feather sessions so I can figure out which nights I'm going to be busy. I'm also looking forward to a number of session tracks that are available (and the inevitable last minute room changes when they realize that people still like to go see Don Box rant on cool stuff).

Hopefully they will have good wireless at the conference so I can keep everyone updated as things happen.

If you're going to be at the PDC and are a regular reader of my blog, leave a comment and let me know!

Okay, another really cool find in Vista today. Instead of trying to look for the program you want in the Start Menu, you just click the windows key (to open the start menu) and start typing the name of the program you want. The built-in search features of Vista will narrow down the start menu options to include only those that contain the string you typed.

You want to run Word, "type Word" and it lists Word as the default and Wordpad as another option. Just smash the Enter key and you're loading Word.

It seems to work pretty well, I'm very glad they added that as it's a great feature for us keyboard cowboys.
